Through the Wire Lyrics
On October 23, 2002, Kanye crashed his car and fractured his jaw. The “Through the Wire” title comes from the fact that Kanye recorded the original version while his mouth was still wired shut. The track…

[Intro: Kanye West & 
Chaka Khan
]
(
Through the test of time
)
Yo, Gee, they can't stop me from rappin', can they?
Can they, Hop?
[Chorus: 
Chaka Khan
]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire
[Post-Chorus: Kanye West]
I spit it through the wire, man
There's too much stuff on my heart right now, man
I'd gladly risk it all right now
It's a life-or-death situation, man
Y'all, y'all don't really understand how I feel right now, man
It's your boy, Kanye To The…
Chi-Town, what's goin' on?
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
Somebody order pancakes, I'll just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wizzerk
How do you console my mom, or give her light support
Tellin' her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she'd been tryna be mine
She a Delta, so she 
been
 throwin' that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryna be lyin', I've been tryna be signed
Tryin' to be a millionaire; ha – I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't tryna make Da Band
I swear, this, right here, history in the makin', man[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire
[Post-Chorus: Kanye West]
I really apologize to everyone right now
If it's unclear at all, man
They got my mouth wired shut
For like… I dunno, the doctor said, like, six weeks
Y'know, he had--I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw
I looked in the mirror–half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man
I couldn't believe it
But I'm still here for y'all right now, man
This what I got to say right here, dawg
Yeah, turn me up, yeah, uh
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talkin' 'bout coke and birds, 
It was more like spoken word, 'cept he's really puttin' it down?
And he explained the story 'bout how Blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt, 
You would know how Mase felt (Mason Betha!)
Thank 
God
 I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to 
God
, driver two wanna sue
I got a lawyer for the case, to keep what's in my safe–safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I…
I looked like Tom Cruise in 
Vanilla Sky
,
 
it was televised
""There's been an accident,"" like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel, 'cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable
, what you thought, they call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
 (Uh-huh)
Toys ""R"" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid [shit] that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
 (Uh-huh! Yeah!)
Make music that's fire,
 
spit my soul through the wire
 (Woo!)[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire
[Post-Chorus: Kanye West]
Y'know what I'm sayin'?
When the doctor told me I had to, um...
I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin...
I said, ""Dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on a plane now?
It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on!""
She can't be serious, man
[Outro: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit
Through the fire, to the limit
Through the fire, to the limit
Through the fire, to the limit
Through the fire, to the limit

""Through the Wire"" peaked at number 15 on the Billboard Hot 100 and received positive reviews from music critics. It was certified Platinum and Gold in the United States and United Kingdom, respectively. The song was nominated for a 2005 Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance, but lost to Jay-Z's ""99 Problems"". The music video was financed by West, who was inspired by an Adidas advertisement. It won Video of the Year at the 2004 Source Hip-Hop Awards.

On October 23, 2002, West was in a California recording studio producing music for Beanie Sigel, Peedi Crakk, and The Black Eyed Peas. After leaving the studio at around 3 a.m. in his rented Lexus, he had a near-fatal crash when he was cut off by a car, ran head-on into traffic, and collided with another car near the W Hotel. He was taken to the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, mentioned in the song as ""the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died,"" and had his jaw wired to his face in reconstructive surgery. Two weeks after being admitted to the hospital, he recorded the song at the Record Plant Studios with his jaw still wired shut. Consequence recalls West started rapping the lyrics to the song three days after the crash.

""The song's title refers to the wires used to hold his broken jaw together. When asked about how the incident changed his music, West stated:
Well, the only thing this accident's is saying is, ""I am about to hand you the world, just know at any given time I can take it away from you."" To nearly lose your life, to nearly lose your mouth, your voice, your whole face, as a rapper...and I had to be on TV! My face looks crazy to me now... But I have to just thank God for the situation that I am in... ""Through The Wire"" is the worst thing that could've possibly happened to me, and now it's obviously the best thing.

I've got every reason on Earth to be mad
'Cause I've just lost the only girl I had
If I could get my way
I'd get myself locked up today
But I can't so I'll cry instead
[Verse 2]
I've got a chip on my shoulder that's bigger than my feet
I can't talk to people that I meet
If I could see you now
I'd try to make you sad somehow
But I can't so I'll cry instead
[Bridge]
Don't wanna cry when there's people there
I get shy when they start to stare
I'm gonna hide myself away, hey
But I'll come back again someday
[Verse 3]
And when I do, you better hide all the girls
I'm gonna break their hearts all 'round the world
Yes, I'm gonna break 'em in two
And show you what your loving man can do
Until then, I'll cry instead[Bridge]

[Verse 1]
She can kill with a smile
She can wound with her eyes
And she can ruin your faith with her casual lies
And she only reveals
What she wants you to see
She hides like a child
But she's always a woman to me
[Verse 2]
She can lead you to love
She can take you or leave you
She can ask for the truth
But she'll never believe you
And she'll take what you give her
As long as it's free
Yeah, she steals like a thief
But she's always a woman to me
[Chorus]
Oh, she takes care of herself
She can wait if she wants
She's ahead of her time
Oh, and she never gives out
And she never gives in
She just changes her mind[Verse 3]
And she'll promise you more
Than the Garden of Eden
Then she'll carelessly cut you
And laugh while you're bleedin'
But she'll bring out the best
And the worst you can be
Blame it all on yourself
Cause she's always a woman to me
[Interlude]
Mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mm
[Chorus]
Oh, she takes care of herself
She can wait if she wants
She's ahead of her time
Oh, and she never gives out
And she never gives in
She just changes her mind
[Verse 4]
She is frequently kind
And she's suddenly cruel
She can do as she pleases
She's nobody's fool
But she can't be convicted
She's earned her degree
And the most she will do
Is throw shadows at you
But she's always a woman to me[Outro]

The single reached No. 17 on the US charts in October 1978, during a period when disco and punk rock were dominating the music scene. Billy Joel wrote this love song for his then-wife Elizabeth Weber, who was also his manager at the time. Weber had helped Joel recover from a disastrous contract with his first record label and played a crucial role in reviving his career in the mid-1970s.

The song's lyrics describe a complex woman with both positive and challenging traits, employing sophisticated literary devices like paradox and juxtaposition throughout. Joel portrays her as someone who can be ""carefully careless"" and ""faithfully faithless,"" using these contradictions to paint a nuanced portrait of feminine strength. While some critics initially interpreted the lyrics as misogynistic, Joel maintained that the song celebrates Weber's business acumen and strong personality in an era when female managers were rare in the music industry. The song reflects the unique dynamic of their relationship, where Weber was both Joel's wife and his business manager, challenging traditional gender roles of the 1970s.

The song experienced a revival in 2010 when Fyfe Dangerfield covered it for a John Lewis advertisement in the UK. This led to Billy Joel's original version re-entering the UK Singles Chart at No. 29 on May 1, 2010. The cover introduced the song to a new generation and demonstrated its timeless appeal across different cultural contexts.

The song's musical composition is particularly noteworthy for its sophisticated chord progressions and waltz-like 6/8 time signature, which was unusual for pop music of the era. The piano arrangement showcases Joel's classical training, while the lyrics demonstrate his gift for storytelling through song. She's Always a Woman remains one of Billy Joel's most beloved and enduring songs, showcasing his talent for crafting emotionally resonant lyrics and memorable melodies. Its influence can be heard in numerous contemporary piano pop ballads, and its exploration of complex relationship dynamics continues to resonate with audiences decades after its release. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Billy+Joel/_/She%27s+Always+a+Woman"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

If I was an angel, I wouldn't have to try
So hard to save you or show you how to fly
If I was an angel, I wouldn't get so mad
It'd be easy to be grateful for everything I have

You'd only get the best of me

I'd pull you out of the darkness
Keep you out of the rain
Everything would be better
I'd never have to change
I'd never have to change

If I was an angel, I'd use only pretty words
And when I'm talking to you, it would never hurt
[Pre-Chorus]
You'd only get the best of me
I'd nevеr make you wanna leave

I'd pull you out of thе darkness
Keep you out of the rain
Everything would be better
You'd never have to change
You'd never have to change
But something's gotta change[Chorus]

I'd never have to change",https://genius.com/Kacey-musgraves-angel-lyrics,"",""

Karma Police, like several other songs that would make up OK Computer, was debuted live in 1996, when the band briefly supported Alanis Morissette on an American tour. A live version of Karma Police, performed with a Rhodes piano on The Late Show with David Letterman, is captured in the Radiohead documentary Meeting People Is Easy. Today the song is usually an audience singalong when performed at live concerts, often as an encore.

Radiohead members used to tell one another that they would call ""the karma police"" on them if they did something wrong. The joke was incorporated as the title of the song. Thom Yorke explained the idea of the lyrics to The Independent in 2006, saying, ""It's for someone who has to work for a large company. This is a song against bosses. Fuck the middle management!"" He also said it was about those who are judgmental. The sound at the end of the song was created by Radiohead guitarist Ed O'Brien by ""feeding sound through a digital delay machine"".

The song was covered in 2003 by Christopher O'Riley on his first Radiohead tribute album True Love Waits: Christopher O'Riley Plays Radiohead. The song has also been covered by Panic at the Disco, The Dresden Dolls and Tori Amos. The song is also covered on the album Radiodread by the Easy Star All-Stars, sung by Citizen Cope.

I just tell a lie

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
I got a bone to pick
I don't want you monkey-mouth motherfuckers
Sittin' in my throne again
Ayy, ayy, nigga, what's happenin'?
K-Dot back in the hood, nigga!
I'm mad (
He mad!
), but I ain't stressin'
True friends, one question
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams—(
What's the yams?
)
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
The yam is the power that be
You can smell it when I'm walkin' down the street
(
Oh yes, we can, oh yes, we can
)
I can dig rappin', but a rapper with a ghostwriter?
What the fuck happened? (
Oh no!
)
I swore I wouldn't tell, but most of y'all sharing bars
Like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell (
A two-man cell
)
Something's in the water (
Something's in the water
)
And if I gotta brown-nose for some gold
Then I'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller (Oh yeah!)[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams—(What's the yams?)
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor
Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires
Twenty-four-seven, three-sixty-five days times two
I was contemplatin' gettin' off stage
Just to go back to the hood, see my enemy, and say… (Oh yeah)
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
You goat-mouth mammyfucker
I was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves
Everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help
This shit is elementary,
 
I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin', ""Compton!""
I should probably run for mayor when I'm done, to be honest
And I put that on my momma and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo-woo!
Aw, yeah, fuck the judge
I made it past twenty-five, and there I was
A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
Screamin', ""Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?""
Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king (
Oh yeah
)
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'—*Gunshot*
By the time you hear the next pop
The funk shall be within you
—*Gunshot*
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him[Outro: Kendrick Lamar & Whitney Alford]
Funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk
We want the funk
We want the funk
Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it?
We want the funk
Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it?
We want the funk
Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it?
We want the funk
Do you want the funk?
We want the funk
Do you want the funk?
We want the funk
Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it?
We want the funk
[Poem: Kendrick Lamar]
I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence",https://genius.com/Kendrick-lamar-king-kunta-lyrics,"Kunta Kinte is the main character in the novel Roots: The Saga of an American Family by Alex Haley. Haley’s said that Kunta Kinte was his own great, great, great grandfather and the character is based on a mix of fact and fiction. Kinte refused to accept the name “Toby” that slave masters tried to give him and his right foot was cut off following his attempts to escape the plantation he was enslaved on.

Kinte refused to accept the name “Toby” that slave masters tried to give him and his right foot was cut off following his attempts to escape the plantation he was enslaved on.

Kendrick Lamar told MTV about his inspiration from the TV series Roots:
""I’ve been called many things growing up. In the state of just being a black man, I’ve been called many things … But it’s taking that negativity and being proud of it and making it your own. Saying I am a king no matter what you call me.""

According to Songfacts, producer Sounwave told Spin magazine:
""Me, I was like, ‘This is it! We got it right here.’ Me and Kendrick, we always work very hands on together, and this track, I just knew it. And I was waiting for his reaction as he was listening to it, thinking, ‘Yes, this is it.’ And he’s like, ‘It’s cool… but… I want it a little more nasty.’ And I was like, ‘What are you talking about? This is like the most beautiful thing I’ve ever made.’ And he was like, ‘Just, trust me on this. Simplify it.’
I ended up stripping a bunch of stuff off; I took all ten guitars off, and it just left one little bass line, and once I did that, I understood 100 percent exactly where he wanted to go with it. He’s a genius, he really should have got credit on it, but he was being modest – as long as the art was there, he was happy. A lot of people will never hear the original but it was, like, the jazziest record in the world. And it ended up being one of the nastiest records in the world.""

Kendrick told NME:
""It’s the story of struggle and standing up for what you believe in. No matter how many barriers you gotta break down, no matter how many escape routes you gotta run to tell the truth. That’s what I think we all can relate to. Just being the most confident in the things that I wrote and the ideas that I have. Going back to the essence of being a true lyricist at heart."" <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Kendrick+Lamar/_/King+Kunta"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

[Verse 1]
I'm not tryna have another conversation
Probably not gon' wanna play me on your station
Pourin' out a bottle full of my frustration
Here to tell you somethin' that you don't know
I'm the type to drive a pickup through your mansion
I'm completely naked, but I'm makin' it fashion
Maybe gettin' married just to cause a distraction
Here to tell you somethin' that you don't know
[Pre-Chorus]
Am I wrong that I moved on and I
And I don't even miss you?
Thought that it'd be you until I die
But I let go
[Chorus]
What the fuck do I know? I'm alone
'Cause I couldn't be somebody's hero
You want an apology? Not from me
Had to leave you in your own misery
So tell me, baby, am I wrong that I moved on?
And I, and I don't even miss you
Thought that it'd be you until I die
But I let go, what the fuck do I know? (Oh)[Verse 2]
Tryin' to see the stars through the new pollution
Think that I'm the problem? Honey, I'm the solution
Maybe all the chaos is for your amusement
Here to tell you somethin' that you don't know
Put you on a pedestal, you're cravin' the spotlight
Desperate for attention, 
nose is bloody, it's daylight
Wakin' up with people that we met for the first time
Loved it, then I hated it, and I let you go
[Chorus]
What the fuck do I know? I'm alone
'Cause I couldn't be somebody's hero
You want an apology? Not from me
I had to leave you in your own misery
So tell me, baby, am I wrong that I moved on?
And I, and I don't even miss you
Thought that it'd be you until I die
But I let go, what the fuck do I know?
[Post-Chorus]
What?
[Chorus]
What the fuck do I know? (Do I know) I'm alone (I'm alone)
'Cause I couldn't be somebody's hero
You want an apology? (Apology) Not from me (Not from me)

Second One to Know Lyrics
Stapleton debuted “Second One to Know” live at the 2017 ACM Awards in Las Vegas on April 2, 2017. It’s the third single that has been released from Chris’s From A Room: Volume 1
[Refrain]
Don't put my love on your back burner
Never let anything that hot get cold
And if you ever change your mind
Want to leave my love behind
Just let me be the second one to know
Yeah, the second one to know
[Verse 1]
Hold up my right hand
Swear to the Promised Land
Rather die before I treat you bad
All I ask from you
Is to treat me the same way, too
'Cause I don't want to lose this thing we have
[Refrain]
Don't put my love on your back burner
Never let anything that hot get cold
And if you ever change your mind
Want to leave my love behind
Just let me be the second one to know
Yeah, the second one to know
[Verse 2]
First, you stole my heart
That was the easy part
Don't ever tell me that crime don't pay
Now that it's in your hands
Want you to understand
I would have given it to you anyway[Refrain / Outro]
Don't put my love on your back burner
Never let anything that hot get cold
And if you ever change your mind
Wanna leave my love behind

Your bodyguard put in some work on a fluke
Now you wanna go and inherit that shit
Don't talk to the boy 'bout comparisons, shit
Or come to the boy on some arrogant shit
The weapons we got are some terrorist shit
Like TV producers we, grr, we airing this shit
She askin' for bread for her parents and shit
I told her I don't got no cash and she said she could wait on a rack, on some Arabic shit
I pull out a million and stare at the shit
My dick just got hard 'cause a wire just hit
My schedule is out, come spin us, for real
Man, fuck all that spinnin' the narrative shit
I melt down the chains that I bought from yo' boss
Give a fuck about all of that heritage shit
Since V not around, the members done hung up the Louis, they not even wearing that shit
Don't come to the boy 'bout repairing some shit
Don't come to the boy about sparing some shit

[Skit: SebastiAn]
No, I was just telling that I, I got this, this girl before
And I was together since three years
And uh, I was not even cheating her or what
And Facebook arrived and, uh
She wanted me to accept her on Facebook
And I don't want it, because I was, like, in front of her
In front of her, and she told me, like, ""Accept me on Facebook""
It was virtual, means no sense
So I say, ""I'm in front of you, I don't need to accept you on Facebook""
She starting to be crazy
She thought that because I didn't accept her, she thought I was cheating
She told me like, uh, ""It's, it's over, I can't believe you""
I said, ""Come on, you're crazy,"" because like, yeah
""I'm in front of you, I'm every day, here in your house""
That's, it means, like, it's jealousy, pure jealousy
For nothing, you know?

Tried to wash all of my shit away
Tried to wash all my emotions
Need a few brews, need a palm tree
I be drinkin' in private, don't call me to party, though
Fuck on your nigga for cardio
Too good, he really fell in love right away
I put my feelings on layaway, I'm
[Pre-Chorus]
Done being used, done playing stupid
Done faking cool
(I don't want none of that shit, I don't want it)
Done being screwed, done feeling clueless
That's how you do
(I don't want none of that shit, got me runnin' so)
[Chorus]
Far, far like I don't recognize me
Far, far 'causе I let you define mе
I'm far, far 'cause I can't trust nobody
Far, stay far, so far[Verse 2]
Lately, I feel less cool as before
(Nobody under my garter belt)
(
Nobody out here to tell me I'm special
)
Made you check your bullshit at the door
(Got an appetite, hungry to feed my ego)
(Nobody 'round me to be my hero)
Always on my mind, trust is hard to find
Everything reminds me of us
I just want my sanity back
Better than being your enemy
(Better than letting go, scared of that, oh)
[Pre-Chorus]
Done being used, done playing stupid
Done being cool
(I don't want none of that shit, I ain't goin')
Done getting screwed, done playing clueless
That's how you do
(I don't want none of that shit, got me runnin' so)
[Chorus]
Far, far like I don't recognize me
Far, far 'cause I let you define me
I'm far, far 'cause I can't trust nobody
Far, stay far, so far[Bridge]
I remember when you had me upside-down
Stress me out and turn me out, it's all bad now
I remember when I wasn't so burnt out
I'd rather that than be your enemy, ready to let it go
[Chorus]
Draggin' me far, far like I don't recognize me
Far, far 'cause I let you define me
I'm far, far 'cause I can't trust nobody

[Verse 1]
I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart, oh
[Chorus]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice
'Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
[Post-Chorus]
Woah, oh, oh
Woah, oh, oh
Woah, oh, oh, oh
[Verse 2]
I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied, oh
Kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again
But uh-oh[Chorus]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice
'Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
[Post-Chorus]
Woah, oh, oh
Woah, oh, oh
Woah, oh, oh, oh
[Bridge]
I'll fix these broken things, repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's alright (It's alright, it's alright, oh-oh)
My pressure on your hips, sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you
Because I know that's what you want me to do
[Chorus]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
Her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice
'Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And my heart is breaking in front of me
She said goodbye too many times before
This love has taken its toll on me (Oh, yeah, yeah)
She said goodbye too many times before (Yeah)
And her heart is breaking in front of me (Yeah)
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore (Yeah)

He has also described the lyrics of this song as being extremely erotic. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Maroon+5/_/This+Love"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","""This Love"" is a song by the American pop rock band Maroon 5. The song was released on January 27, 2004, as the second single from their debut album Songs About Jane (2002). The track is built around a piano-led strut and a repeating guitar sound.

The song's lyrics are based on Levine's break-up with an ex-girlfriend. He revealed that the song was written in the ""most emotionally trying time"" in his life. He has also described the lyrics of this song as being extremely erotic. ""This Love"" was critically acclaimed by music critics, who noted the track's musicscape.

The song entered the top ten on most charts, topping several of Billboard magazine's component charts, including reaching the number one spot on the Hot Adult Top 40 Tracks chart. The music video was met with controversy, regarding extended intimate scenes between Levine and his then-girlfriend. ""This Love"" helped Maroon 5 win the MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist and was the third most played song of 2004. The live version of the song won Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals at the 2006 Grammy Awards and to date, this is one of Maroon 5's most successful songs.

Background
""This Love"" was the second single from Maroon 5's 2002 debut album, Songs About Jane. In an interview with MTV News in August 2002, Maroon 5 vocalist Adam Levine revealed that he wrote the song the day his girlfriend moved away after they broke up. In another interview, Levine revealed that the song was written in the ""most emotionally trying time"" in his life. He also added, ""I was in a relationship that was ending, but I was really excited on the other end because the band was about to go make the record and I was ecstatic to go in the studio. She was literally leaving town within days of me writing the lyrics to 'This Love', so I was in prime emotional condition to write a song with that kind of conflict.""

Music and lyrics
During development of ""This Love"", the band stated that the song was influenced by musician Stevie Wonder. The piece was written in the key of C minor, the metre is set in common time, and the piece's tempo is a moderate 95 beats per minute. The introduction of ""This Love"" features a piano-led strut. Maroon 5 has called ""This Love"" a prime pop-rock song. The music featured in the song has a lot more rock-guitar crunch, and is considered a soulful, pop rock and alternative rock song. According to Johnny Loftus of Allmusic, the music featured in the song has ""a slick channeling of vintage R&B rhythms into punchy pop dynamics"". Loftus felt that the song features ""Levine's wry falsetto around strutting, bottom-heavy piano and percussion both programmed and live; chirping backup vocals and washes of sunny synth and flute acted as counterweights"". Loftus also noted that the band has a ""sexual charge"" with the lyrics, ""I tried my best to feed her appetite / To keep her coming every night / So hard to keep her satisfied"". The Boston Globe's Steve Morse described the single's sounds as ""a rocking yet soulful tale about the breakup of a relationship"". Meghan Bard of The Daily Campus adds that the song has ""Stevie Wonder-esque vocals and a funky R&B beat"". In the extended version of the song, which is 4 minutes and 26 seconds long, the chorus of the band's next single, ""She Will Be Loved"", can be heard from 3:21 to 3:42, during the outro.

In an interview with Rolling Stone, when asked about the lyrics ""Keep her coming every night"" and ""Sinking my fingertips into every inch of you"", Levine said: ""Yep, that's sexual, all right. I was so sick of typical lyrics like 'Ooh, baby' and 'I love you' and all this vague shit. I thought the more explicit I got without being totally explicit was a nice approach. The little girls would enjoy them, and it would go right over my grandparents' heads. But it would hit my ex-girlfriend like a ton of bricks. It was perfect."" He also comments on how MTV played an edited version of the song for the music video, with the word ""coming"" edited out of the line ""keep her coming every night"". Levine noted, ""MTV has now edited the language. They won't let me say, 'Keep her coming every night', and they took the sinking out of 'sinking my fingertips'. It's like communist China. It's totally bizarre.""

Reception
The song received critical acclaim. In the Rolling Stone review of the album, critic Christian Hoard wrote: ""Adam Levine's urban-romantic swoonings work best when his band really gets up on the good foot, as on 'This Love', which uses piano and James Brown-like guitars to create a foundation on which Levine can obsess about beauty (including his own)."" Jason Thompson of PopMatters noted that on the songs ""This Love"" and ""Must Get Out"", keyboardist Jesse Carmichael ""manages to conjure up both the productions of Britney Spears and The New Radicals respectively"". Sam Beresky of the Daily Lobo, who was less enthusiastic about the album, complimented the band on ""This Love"", in which he noted, ""...'This Love', is a happier version of the first with a great backbeat reminiscent of Stevie Wonder's 'Superstition'. It might make a foot tap, a head nod or even a booty shake if played at a loud volume.""

In May 2004, musician John Mayer told Rolling Stone that he liked the band's album Songs About Jane. Mayer was also positive towards the song. ""Once I heard 'This Love,' it was a light-fuse/stand-back kind of situation. It's one of those perfect songs you always hope to write."" The single also strengthened Maroon 5's appeal, and helped position them as one of the year's break-out bands in 2004. It has since been remixed by Kanye West, titled ""This Love (Kanye West remix)"", in May 2004. The band released an EP titled 1.22.03.Acoustic, which features an acoustic version of ""This Love.""

Chart performance
""This Love"" appeared on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at No. 5. The track's Junior Vasquez Mixes remix topped the Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. It also appeared in the Hot Dance Airplay chart at No. 18. ""This Love"" reached No. 1 on Billboard's Top 40 Mainstream. It also reached the top spot on Billboard's Hot Adult Top 40 Tracks at the No. 1 spot, it stayed there for 10 weeks. The song was the top digital download of 2004. In 2007, the song re-entered the chart at the No. 36 position on Billboard's Hot Digital Songs. As of June 2014, the song has sold 2,120,000 copies in the US.

""This Love"" reached the Top 10 in twelve countries. In the United Kingdom, it reached the No. 3 spot in the UK Singles Chart on May 1, 2004. It entered the top ten in France, Belgium, and Australia. The single reached the top five in Norway, Switzerland, Netherlands, Austria, and New Zealand. Elsewhere, ""This Love"" appeared on the Italy, Swiss, Germany, and Ireland music charts.

Music video
The music video for ""This Love"" premiered on MTV's Total Request Live on January 6, 2004. Directed by Sophie Muller, the video combines performance footage from the band in a courtyard built at Mack Sennett Studios and scenes of Adam Levine parting ways with a woman. According to Levine, the concept behind the music video was based on Prince. ""An overt sexuality confuses people, too. That video was a very 'pop star' thing to do.""

The music video also features Levine and his then-girlfriend, model Kelly McKee in a few intimate scenes. The video used creative camera angles, in an effort to avoid action from the Federal Communications Commission for television broadcasts. A version of the video where a stream of computer-generated flowers obscure the screen further was also created. When asked about the video, Levine said: ""It was surprisingly not weird and surprisingly not sexual. It was totally comfortable. I didn't get horny or anything, which was weird since I shot it with my girlfriend.""

Still, the video was seen as controversial, with Sylvia Patterson of The Daily Telegraph describing it as ""a porno-pop video"". Bass player Michael Madden, asked to comment on the video's reception, referred to the controversy as ""an absurd over-reaction."" <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Maroon+5/_/This+Love"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky
Gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Back when they thought pink Polos would hurt the Roc
Before Cam got the shit to pop
The doors was closed
I felt like Bad Boy's street team: I couldn't work the locks
Now let's go, take 'em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in that U-Haul van
Any pessimists, I ain't talk to them
Plus I ain't have no phone in my apart-a-ment
Let's take 'em back to the club
Least about an hour I stand on line
I just wanted to dance,
 
I went to Jacob an hour
After I got my advance, I just wanted to shine
Jay favorite line: ""Dawg, in due time!""
Now he look at me, like, ""Damn, dawg! You where I am!""
A hip-hop legend
I think I died in that accident, ‘cause this must be Heaven[Chorus: Kanye West]
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky
Gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky
[Post-Chorus: Kanye West]
Now let's take them hi-ah-igh-igh-igh-ighhhh
(Top of the world, baby, top, top of the world!)
A-la-la-la-lah-la-lahhhhh
(Top of the world, baby, on top of the world!)
Now let's take them hi-ah-igh-igh-igh-ighhhh
(Top of the world, baby, top, top of the world!)
A-la-la-la-lah-la-lahhhhh
(Top of the world, baby, on top of the world!)
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Back when Gucci was the shit to rock
Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop
I'd do anything to say I got it
Damn, them new loafers hurt my pocket
Before anybody wanted K. West beats
Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC
Dawg, I was havin' nervous breakdowns
Like ""Man, these niggas that much better than me?""
Baby, I'm goin' on an aeroplane
And I don't know if I'll be back again
Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets
But when she came to kick it, things became different
Any girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on
Couldn't keep it at home, thought I needed a Nia Long
I'm tryin' to right my wrongs
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song, now[Chorus: Kanye West]
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
You gon' touch the sky, baby girl, testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Yes, yes, yes, guess who's on third?
Lupe steal like Lupin the 3rd
Here like ear 'til I'm beer on the curb
Peachfuzz buzz but beard on the verge
Let's slow it down like we're on the syrup
Bottle-shaped body like Mrs. Butterworth
But before you say another word
I'm back on the block like I'm layin' on the street
I'm tryna stop lyin' like I'm Mumm-Ra
But I'm not lyin' when I'm layin' on the beat,
 
en garde
Or touché, Lupe cool as the unthawed
But I still feel possessed as a gun charge
Come as correct as a porn star
In a fresh pair steps in my best foreign car
So, I represent the first
Now let me end my verse right where the horns are, like uh[Chorus: Kanye West]
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
You gon' touch the sky, baby girl, testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
[Outro: Kanye West]
We back at home, baby!
Sky high, I’m, I’m sky high!
I’m, I’m sky high!
I’m, I’m sky high!
I’m, I’m sky high!
I’m, I’m sky high!
Sky, sky high! I’m, I’m sky high!
Yeah, keep it rollin'!
Yeah, uh, feels good to be home, baby!
Feels good to be home!

Ain't nobody got no patience
Want what they want right now (One more time)

Ain't nobody got no patience
Want what they want right now
Ain't no need in being so anxious
I can hear your heart beating out loud

Quit acting like we're in a race
Beggin' me, you know I'm on the way over
Take a moment to cherish this space
So quick to move forward, no pressure

And we got the rest
Got the rest, got the rest of our lives

Shot Down in Flames Lyrics
[Intro]

Woah

Woah
One, two
[Verse 1]
Out on the town, lookin' for a woman
Gonna give me good love
Anybody want to hang off of me
And give me plenty of
She was standin' alone over by the jukebox
Like she's somethin' to sell
I said, ""Baby, what's the goin' price?""
She told me to go to hell
[Chorus]
Shot down in flames
Shot down in flames
Ain't it a shame
To be shot down in flames?
[Verse 2]
Singles bar, got my eye on a honey
Hangin' out everywhere
She might be straight, she might want my money
I really don't care, no
Said, ""Baby, you're drivin' me crazy""
Laid it right on the line
When a guy with a chip on his shoulder said
""Toss off, buddy, she's mine""[Chorus]
Shot down in flames
Shot down in flames
Ain't it a shame, yeah
To be shot down in flames?

Hey, you, Angus
Shoot me, shoot

[Verse 1]
Niggas wanna shine like me (Me), rhyme like me (Me)
They don't walk around with a .9 like me (Me)
They don't want to do it three-to-nine like me
And ain't strong enough to take nine like me
Ayo, you think about shittin' on 50, save it
My songs belong in the Bible with King David's
I teach niggas sign language that ain't deaf, son
(*Click-clack*) You heard that? That mean run
Ask around, I ain't the one you wanna stunt on, pa
Pull through, I throw a fucking cocktail at your car
From the last shootout I got a dimple on my face
It's nothing, I can go after Ma$e fan base
A shell hit my jaw, I ain't wait for doc to get it out
Hit my wisdom tooth, I (Huck-too) spit it out
I don't smile a lot 'cause ain't nothin' pretty
Got a purple heart for war and I ain't never left the city
Hoes be like ""50, you so witty""
On the dick like they heard I ghostwrite for P. Diddy
You got fat while we starved, it's my turn
I done felt how the shells burn, I still won't learn
, won't learn[Chorus]
If you get shot and run to the cops, you not like me
You ain't got no work on the block, you not like me
It's hot and you ain't got no drop, you not like me
Like me, dude, you not like me
If you get shot and run to the cops, you not like me
You ain't got no work on the block, you not like me
It's hot and you ain't got no drop, you not like me
Like me, dude, you not like me
[Verse 2]
Mama said everything that happened to us was part of God's plan
So at night, when I talk to him, I got my gun in my hand
Don't think I'm crazy 'cause I don't fear man
'Cause I 
fear
 when I kill a man God won't understand
I got a head full of evil thoughts, am I Satan?
I been could've killed these niggas, I'm still waitin'
In the telly with two whores, Benz with two doors
Thirty-two karats in the cross, no flaws (Woo)
You see me in the hood, I got at least two guns
I carry the Glock, Tony carry my M-1
Hold me down, nigga, OGs tryin' to rock me (Uh-huh)
Ds waiting for my response to lock me (Yeah)
This is my hustle, nigga, don't knock me
You need some shit with a banana clip to try and stop me,
 
I'm the one[Chorus]
If you get shot and run to the cops, you not like me
You ain't got no work on the block, you not like me
It's hot and you ain't got no drop, you not like me
Like me, dude, you not like me
If you get shot and run to the cops, you not like me
You ain't got no work on the block, you not like me
It's hot and you ain't got no drop, you not like me
Like me, dude, you not like me
[Verse 3]
See, I done been to the pearly gates, they sent me back
Good die young, I ain't eligible for that
I shot niggas, I been shot, sold crack in the street
My attitude is gangsta, so I stay in some beef
You wanna get acquainted with me? You wanna know me?
From three-point range with a Glock, I shoot better than Kobe
See a nigga standing next to me, he probably my co-D
See a bitch gettin' in my whip, she probably gon' blow me
See the flow is like a .38, it's special, y'all
A country boy tell ya I'm finna blow
I'm more like a pimp than a trick, you know
You see, I'm in this for the paper, I don't love the hoes
Niggas broke in the hood worryin' about mines
Grown-ass men wearing starter kit shines
You know them little pieces with the little stones
Got little clientele fiends call your cell phone
When the gossipin' start, I'm always the topic
You too old for that shit, dawg, won't you stop it?
Shorty, I've been watching you watching me
Now you tell me what you like more, my watch or me? Haha[Chorus]
If you get shot and run to the cops, you not like me
You ain't got no work on the block, you not like me
It's hot and you ain't got no drop, you not like me
Like me, dude, you not like me
If you get shot and run to the cops, you not like me
You ain't got no work on the block, you not like me
It's hot and you ain't got no drop, you not like me
Like me, dude, you not like me

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Ride for it every night
Visions and these angles tight
Truth be told, I never try
Diamonds are the wife of life
All three Rollies look alike (Hm)
After two you get a hook-up price
Stripper never worked a nine-to-five (Hm)
Delta and I ship it overnight (Hm)
Stop tryna be God Almighty (Hm)
Fuck the money, never leave your people behind, yeah
It's never love, no matter what you try
Still can see it comin' down your eyes
'Cause they did not create commandments (Ooh-ooh)
When you hustle, always make it fancy (Ooh-ooh)
The signal's far from what you can be (Ooh-ooh)
'Cause air traffic controls the landing, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah[Chorus: Kid Cudi &

Stop tryna play God Almighty
Always keep your circle tight
I been wantin' shit my whole life
I'm warning you, better not try to play God tonight
If I love her, I'ma pass on her
First rule of war, you find an act on her
You can't win a trophy or a plaque off her
But never turn your back on her
'Cause they did not create commandments
When you hustle, always make it fancy
The signal's far from what you can be
'Cause air traffic controls the landing, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You won't succeed tryna learn me
Stick to the roads in my journey
Stay out of court when you got the attorney
She say she love, but want to really burn me[Chorus: Kid Cudi &

[Bridge: James Blake]
Is it the complex of the saint
That's keepin' you so, so, so still still?
Is it a coat of old paint
That's peelin' every day against our will?
Is it too long since the last
Open conversation you had? Oh, no
And did you see the void in the past?
And can you ever see it comin' back?
Well, can you always be a step ahead of it for me?
Well, can you always be a step ahead of it for me?

“My next album is going to have Stevie [Wonder]. Well, I’m trying. We’re talking.”

[Verse 1]
Transport, motorways and tramlines
Starting and then stopping
Taking off and landing
The emptiest of feelings
Disappointed people
Clinging onto bottles
And when it comes it's so, so disappointing
[Chorus]
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around

Shell smashed, juices flowing
Wings twitch, legs are going
Don't get sentimental
It always ends up drivel
One day I am gonna grow wings
A chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless
Hysterical and

Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around[Bridge]
Let down and hang...
Let down and hang...
Let down and hang...

You know, you know where you are with
You know where you are with
Floor collapsing
Floating, bouncing back
And one day, I am gonna grow wings
A chemical reaction (You know where you are)
Hysterical and useless (You know where you are)
Hysterical and (You know where you are)

""Let Down"" was recorded at 3 a.m. in the ballroom of St Catherine's Court, when the band found inspiration. It makes extensive use of the natural reverberation of the location. This song is best known for its third verse, where Thom Yorke duets with himself across the stereo field, accompanied by the sounds of a ZX Spectrum computer.

It primarily deals with disappointment, in all its forms. From one's disappointment with the monotony of modern life ('Transport, motorways and tramlines'), to the seemingly never-ending cycle of disappointment perpetuated by the places and people in your life ('You know where you are with'). And yet, you continue to interact with it all despite being aware of it ('... And hanging around'). A yearning to break this cycle is illustrated through the image of a swatted butterfly, awaiting a new metamorphosis. ('One day, I am gonna grow wings' / 'A chemical reaction' / 'Hysterical and useless' /' Hysterical and'). This theme is similar to another track on OK Computer, ""No Surprises"".

The “clinging on to bottles” line originated from an idea that Yorke thought was hilarious, explaining ""I was pissed in a club, and I suddenly had the funniest thought I’d had for ages – what if all the people who were drinking were hanging from the bottles… If the bottles were hung from the ceiling with string, and the floor caved in, and the only thing that kept everyone up was the bottles? It’s also about an enormous fear of being trapped."" <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/_/Let+Down"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

I'm fuckin' with they mind, I make 'em press rewind
They know they can't shine if I'm around to rhyme
Been on parole since '94 'cause I commit the crime
I send you my line, I did a three-to-nine

She look good, but I know she after my cheddar
She tryin' to get in my pockets, homie, and I ain't gon' let her
Be easy, start some bullshit, you get your whole crew wet

Me, I'm no wanksta, me, I'm no actor
But it's me you see on your TV

By any means, partner, I got to eat on these streets
When you play me close, for sure I'm gonna pop my heat

Equipped with night vision, shell catchers and inf-beams, huh?

You say you gangsta, but you never pop nothin'
We say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership, but you never cop nothin'

It was a bonus track (track 17) on his 2003 commercial debut album Get Rich or Die Tryin' Eminem also made a remix aimed at Ja Rule and tweeked the beat to sound high pitched.

The song's lyrics are believed to speak against long time nemesis Ja Rule, but 50 Cent disputed this himself in a MuchMusic interview, stating that the song was not directed against Ja Rule, ""But Ja Rule is a wanksta"".

The instrumental for the song was used for ""Crackin"", a song by The Psychopathic Rydas. It was also used for ""The Real Wanksta"" by Black Child, who is signed to The Inc. and was beefing with 50 because he was affiliated with Ja Rule.

R&B girl group Blaque recorded an answer song entitled ""No Ganksta"" in 2003. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/50+Cent/_/Wanksta"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."

The song is moored to a repetitive bassline, has a processed electronic production, and develops in a direction influenced by jazz.
In the album recording, the bass is played by lead singer Thom Yorke, who wrote the riff at age 16. The song is thought to have been previously attempted at recording sessions in 1994 and 1997, but according to Colin Greenwood, the band decided it was ""too good to use it as a b-side for OK Computer singles"".

The free jazz-style brass section featured in this song creates a soundscape of chaos and has been described as ""a brass band marching into a brick wall"" by one reviewer. In the recording sessions, band members Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood conducted the session with musicians as best they could, though Yorke lacks formal musical training, telling them to 'go crazy' with their instruments as if they were caught in a traffic jam. It should be noted that although the recording sounds chaotic, each instrument is soloing to the riff.

The jazz-style arrangement was apparently influenced by Charles Mingus, one of Thom's favorite composers, while the song also features an Ondes Martenot, played by Jonny Greenwood. That early electronic instrument was picked up by Jonny for several songs on Kid A and subsequent albums, inspired by the music of Olivier Messiaen which makes much use of it. Some also found ""The National Anthem"" reminiscent of the contemporary work of fellow UK bands Primal Scream and Spiritualized, with whom Radiohead had toured in 1998.

""The National Anthem"" was the opening song for most Radiohead concerts in 2000–2001, and is the first track on the band's 2001 album I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings. As of 2008, Radiohead continues to play it live. The song begins on stage with the band tuning to various radio stations, then mixing the transmissions and static with the bassline. When the song is played live, normal Radiohead bassist Colin Greenwood plays the riff, which uses a Lovetone Big Cheese effects pedal to create a more distorted ""fuzz"" sound. The ondes martenot is also more audible in live versions, thanks to the addition of guitarist Ed O'Brien, who both doubles and expands on Jonny's parts. Thom Yorke also adds scat singing in some performances. Unlike the studio-recorded version on the Kid A album, the live version of the song is often not performed with a brass section. Radiohead has performed with a brass section in their 2000 performances in New York City (one of which was at Radiohead's taping for Saturday Night Live using the house band), a 2001 performance in London for the BBC's Later with Jools Holland, and during a 2001 concert in Paris.

During their 2008 tour for In Rainbows, Radiohead asked fans to provide travel information and other data regarding the carbon footprint of the tour, giving away free live recordings in return. While some participants received a link to the download of a soundboard recording of 'Bangers And Mash' from June 6, 2008, or a recording of 'Nude' from June 18, 2008, others were sent a link to a recording of 'The National Anthem' from august 9th 2008, the band's second performance at the All Points West Festival. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/_/The+National+Anthem"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Fuck You Lyrics
The third track off of Dre’s 2001 album, featuring two other veterans. As far as the song goes, it’s mostly about what the title says, and that’s playing with some girl friends.
[Intro: 
Girl on answering machine
]
Hi, baby
I know you're under a lot of pressure at your work and all
And I do understand
You have no idea how much I understand
But you also don't have any idea how much I love you
I love you so much
I think about you, I feel you in my arms
I miss you, I miss you terribly
I've just always wanted someone like you in my life
I love you so much that I'd do anything, I'd do anything
I'll be your perfect woman for you
[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
I just wanna fuck bad bitches
For all them nights I never had bitches
Now I'm all up in that ass, bitches
Mad at your boyfriend, ain't 'cha?
You's a bad girl, 
gotta
 spank ya
And gotta thank ya for that head clinic
Explicit, hella photogenic
And tell your friends where the dick's at
Where they can get hit and won't get back to they soulmate
Before you kiss 'em, use Colgate
She swallowed it, yeah, the bitch took the whole eight
And ran with it, then let Mel-Man hit it
And Hittman hit it – damn, bitches
Man, this is what I'm talkin' 'bout
Chickenhead, chicken fed, with a dick in your mouth
Out and about with your nigga like it never took place
(AirTouch me)
 Next time you need a taste[Chorus: Devin the Dude]
I just wanna fuck you
No touchin' and rubbin', girl
You've got a husband who loves you
Don't need you all in mine
I just wanna fuck you
We can't be kissin' and huggin', girl
You've got a husband who loves you
You need to give him your quality time
[Verse 2: Devin the Dude]
You got the number, it's on you to make the call
You know I come quick, help you redecorate your walls
Cut your backyard, don’t have to act hard to get the cock
And if I'm going too far, I take it out and wipe it off
And put it back up, and keep goin’
You tryin' to hide it from your husband, but I know he be knowin'
That your pussy's been tampered with
Did you show him that new trick
Of how you can make it smoke a cancer stick?
You be workin' it like a dancer, bitch – it's hard on me
Not to give you all of my time that you wanted
You can give me some head, but keep the breakfast in bed
I'd rather spend my mornin’ diggin' through some records instead
But tonight, I guess it'd be aight if we can touch bases
Hook up somewhere and exchange some Fuck Faces
I know your man's lookin’ for ya, he's always tryna run ya
Don't worry 'bout me handcuffin', girl, 'cause I just wanna–[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Fuck with you on the sneak tip, on some creep shit
So what you gon' do, you freak bitch?
You actin’ like you don't do dicks
That's the kinda bitch I hate fuckin' with
Baby was a virgin, that's what she said
So I gave her some Hennessy, she gave me some head
I fucked her on the floor, so I wouldn't mess up my bed
Then Lil' ½ Dead put his dick on her head
Take that bitch home and give her a bone
And give her the number to my cellular phone
Now she's blowin' up my pager, the shit's gettin' major
A favor for a favor, this dick is what I gave her
Somethin' to go by and bitches know why
Stuff dick in they mouth and then I'm out (See ya)
24/7, Dre, Snoop, and Devin
We servin' these hoes and never lovin' these hoes (Biatch)
[Chorus: Devin the Dude]
I just wanna fuck you
No touchin' and rubbin', girl

Don't need you all in mine

Teach ya how to turn Yayo into dough
The original don dada, nobody bomb harder
Ya heard what I said boy, I'm hot, I'm hot
The hoodrats, they say ""He so crazy""
The snitches, they say ""He tried to spray me""
But that's what you get for tryna play me
The aftermath of my wrath is so shady
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop this
I catch ya stunting in the Bentley Coupé cockpit
If you a pimp, why ya hoes stay outta pocket?
Front and find out how my P-40 Glock hit
""50, you need some help?""
 Chill, Yayo, I got this
See, where I'm from, man, the D's tryin' to knock us
They swear to God that it's me selling the choppers
Man, I ain't give them little niggas no product[Chorus: 50 Cent]

The birds they say I got a way with words
I be like ""Baby girl, I like them curves""
If ya not busy tonight then we can swerve
I'm a bachelor, baby, fuck what you heard
[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
From the Telly in ten minutes I'll make you a believer
Tongue touch ya, I'll have ya shakin' like you havin' a seizure
I make hits about what I do in my leisure
G-Unit gang, can't another clique out there see us
Niggas lip sync the lyrics 'cause they wanna be us
Groupie hoes from the hood, they be tryna G us
Tryna holla at the kid every time they see us
Girlfriend quit pretending, I'm the nigga ya love
And I ain't got to say nothing, you know that I'm thuggin'
Put my hands on that ass and ya say that I'm buggin'
We family, baby, kissin' cousins
Now, look what the riff raff done drug in
For the cheese, my degrees is hotter than ya oven
I'm a New Yorker, but I sound Southern
And we sip DP 'til the Don stop bubblin'
After we play, okay, go to ya husband[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I know you like my style (Uh-huh)
But how much do you like my style? (Uh-huh)
You like how I break it down (Uh-huh)
Wanna get rich? I'll show you how (Uh-huh)

Wrap up your drugs, come make me happy
Sex with me is amazing, with her it'll feel alright

AMERIICAN REQUIEM Lyrics
‘AMERIICAN REQUIEM’ opens ‘COWBOY CARTER’ – Beyoncés eighth studio album and the second part of her trilogy project that began with the release of ‘RENAISSANCE’ in 2022.
[Intro]
Nothin' really ends
For things to stay the same, they have to change again
Hello, my old friend
You change your name, but not the ways you play pretend
American Requiem
Them big ideas (Yeah), are buried here (Yeah)
Amen
[Chorus]
It's a lot of talkin' goin' on
While I sing my song
Can you hear me?
I said, ""Do you hear me?""
[Pre-Chorus]
Looka there, looka there now
Looka there, looka there
Looka-looka, looka there, looka there
Looka-looka, looka there, looka there
Looka-looka, looka there, looka there (Oh)
Looka-looka, looka there, looka there (Yeah)
[Chorus]
It's a lotta chatter in here
But let me make myself clear (Oh)
Can you hear me? (Huh)
Or do you fear me? (Ow)[Verse 1]
Can we stand for something?
Now is the time to face the wind (Ow)
Coming in peace and love, y'all
Oh, a lot of takin' up space
Salty tears beyond my gaze
Can you stand me?
(Can you stand me? Can you stand me? Can you stand me?)
Ooh, ah
Can we stand?
(Can you stand me? Can you stand me? Can you stand me?
Can you stand me? Can you stand me? Can you stand me?)
Can you stand with me?
[Chorus]
Can we stand for something?
Now is the time to face the wind
Now ain't the time to pretend
Now is the time to let love in
[Bridge]
Thinkin' to myself (Thinkin' to myself)
Oh, it's a lot of talkin' goin' on (Oh)
While I sing my song (Yeah)
Do you hear me when I say?
Do you hear me when I say? Ah[Pre-Chorus]
Looka there, looka there
Looka, look
Looka-looka-looka-looka-looka
Looka-looka there, looka there
L-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-looka there
Oh, looka there, looka there
Looka there, looka there
(Can you stand me? Can you stand me? Can you stand me?)
L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L
(Can you stand me? Can you stand me? Can you stand me?)
[Chorus]
Can we stand for something?
Now is the time to face the wind (Now is the time to face the wind)
Now ain't the time to pretend
Now is the time to let love in (To let love in)
Together, can we stand?
[Verse 2]
Looka there
, 
looka in my hand
The grandbaby of a moonshine man
Gadsden, Alabama
Got folk down in Galveston, rooted in Louisiana
Used to say I spoke too country
And the rejection came, said I wasn't country 'nough
Said I wouldn't saddle up, but
If that ain't country, tell me what is?
Plant my bare feet on solid ground for years
They don't, don't know how hard I had to fight for this
When I sang my song[Outro]
(When I sang the song of Abraham)
(When the angels guide and take my hand)
(Oh, no)
Goodbye to what has been
A pretty house that we never settled in
A funeral for fair-weather friends
I am the one to cleanse me of
 
my Father's sins
American Requiem
Them big ideas (Yeah) are buried here (Yeah)
Amen",https://genius.com/Beyonce-ameriican-requiem-lyrics,"‘AMERIICAN REQUIEM’ opens ‘COWBOY CARTER’ – Beyoncés eighth studio album and the second part of her trilogy project that began with the release of ‘RENAISSANCE’ in 2022. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Beyonc%C3%A9/_/AMERIICAN+REQUIEM"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","‘AMERIICAN REQUIEM’ opens ‘COWBOY CARTER’ – Beyoncés eighth studio album and the second part of her trilogy project that began with the release of ‘RENAISSANCE’ in 2022. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Beyonc%C3%A9/_/AMERIICAN+REQUIEM"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Razor Blade Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You're not looking for anything more than a
Good time and an open door
A good band and a dance floor
Then she walks in
You got a pickup line to throw, but
She walks up and says ""hello""
Before you can even let it go
She's got you reeled in
[Pre-Chorus]
You can't escape it if you wanted to
You don't know what you got yourself into
[Chorus]
You're blindfolded yo
Walking south down the whiskey tracks
She's rolling north like a neon train
Bolt of lightning in the night
Speed of light, you won't realize
You've been struck 'til you see the flame
Her smile'll slice you to the heart
There you are in the back of a bar
Bleeding, but you feel no pain
She won't cut you like a knife, like a knife
That little look in her eyes'll
Cut you like a razor blade
You wait[Verse 2]
You ain't used to playing by these rules
So you sit there and try to play it cool
Do your best not to play the fool
But it's too late now
You wanna see how far she'll let you go
She'll let you think you're in control
[Chorus]
You're blindfolded
Walking south down the whiskey tracks
She's rolling north like a neon train
Bolt of lightning in the night
Speed of light, you won't realize
You been struck 'til you see the flame
Her smile'll slice you to the heart
There you are in the back of a bar
Bleeding, but you feel no pain
She won't cut you like a knife, like a knife
That little look in her eyes'll
Cut you like a razor blade
[Bridge]
You can't escape it if you wanted to
You don't know what you got yourself into[Chorus]
You're blindfolded
Walking south down the whiskey tracks
She's rolling north like a neon train
Bolt of lightning in the night
Speed of light, you won't realize
You been struck 'til you see the flame
Her smile'll slice you to the heart
There you are in the back of a bar
Bleeding, but you feel no pain
She won't cut you like a knife, like a knife
That little look in her eyes'll
Cut you like a razor blade
She won't cut you like a knife, like a knife
That little look in her eyes'll
Cut you like a razor blade
Cut you like a razor blade
She cut you like a razor blade",https://genius.com/Luke-bryan-razor-blade-lyrics,"",""

Shit I’m Dreaming Lyrics
Used to think I was a man
Above these things
And all their plans
Thought I was
By the hat
Oh what they loved
I don't understand
But now I want
What I can
Shit I'm dreaming
Again
I didn't need
No house no cars
Just a little place
For my ma
A place which can touch the sea
Shit I'm dreaming
Again
I'm dreaming
Again
I've been put
In my place
Shown I'm just another
Kind of slave
Even though I sing and wave
Shit I'm dreaming
Again
I'm dreaming
AgainThey all treat me
Like a dog
Like I'm just another
Cog
But they can all
Suck my cock
Shit I'm dreaming
Again
I'm dreaming
Again
Just fuck over all those fools
And you'll be winning again",https://genius.com/Peter-cat-recording-co-shit-im-dreaming-lyrics,"",""

[Verse 1]
I'm on the roof
You're in your airplane seat
I was nose-bleedin'
Looking for life out there
Readin' your horoscope
You were just doing cocaine in my kitchen
You never listen
I hope you're missing me by now
[Pre-Chorus]
If I was a bluebird, I would fly to you
You'd be the spoon
Dip you in honey so I could be sticking to you

Daylight, you got me cursing the daylight (Ooh)
Daylight, you got me cursing the daylight (Ooh)
Daylight, you got me calling at all times (Ooh)
Ain't gonna sleep till the daylight (Ooh)

Out of New York
I'm on the comedown speed
We're on bicycles
Saying, ""There's life out therе""
You've got the antidote
I'll takе one to go, go, please
Get the picture, cut out my middle
You ain't got time for me right now[Pre-Chorus]
If I was a bluebird, I would fly to you
You'd be the spoon
Dip you in honey so I could be sticking to you

In a May 2022 interview for the Howard Stern Show, the British singer declared that “Daylight” was written in a “stream-of-consciousness” style after ruminating on a relationship all night—the band stayed up until daylight to finish composing the song.

Additionally, after numerous speculations, Styles confirmed to Howard Stern that the song had no connection to his former girlfriend Taylor Swift’s track “Daylight” from the album ""Lover""—a song about finding a healthy new love after a period of toxic relationships.

""You are reading too much into it. You know I’d love to tell you that you’re spot-on, but you’re not. We will always wonder.""

""We were like, ‘We have to find a way to stay awake and finish this, because if we all go to bed, then this won’t turn out the way it would if we finished tonight.’ So we powered through, finished it and went down to the beach as the sun was coming up and it was like, ‘Okay. Yeah.’ It felt correct that we’d finished it in that place. Life, and songs in particular, are so much about moments. In surfing, for example, sometimes you don’t get the wave and sometimes the wave comes and you haven’t practised. But every now and again, the wave comes and you’re ready, you’ve practised enough that you can ride it. Sometimes when the songs write themselves like that, it feels like, ‘Okay, there’s a reason why sometimes I sit out there, falling off the board a bunch. It’s for this moment.""

[Spoken Verse]
Fitter, happier, more productive
Comfortable
, not drinking too much
Regular exercise at the gym three days a week
Getting on better with your associate employee contemporaries
At ease
Eating well
No more microwave dinners and saturated fats
A patient, better driver
A safer car
Baby smiling in back seat
Sleeping well, no bad dreams
No paranoia
Careful to all animals
Never washing spiders down the plughole
Keep in contact with old friends
Enjoy a drink now and then
Will frequently check credit at moral bank
Hole in wall
Favors for favors
Fond, but not in love
Charity standing orders
On Sundays ring road supermarket
No killing moths or putting boiling water on the ants
Car wash, also on Sundays
No longer afraid of the dark or midday shadows
Nothing so ridiculously teenage and desperate
Nothing so childish
At a better pace
Slower and more calculated
No chance of escape
Now self-employed
Concerned, but powerless
An empowered and informed member of society
 
Pragmatism, not idealism
Will not cry in public
Less chance of illness
Tires that grip in the wet
Shot of baby strapped in back seat
A good memory
Still cries at a good film
Still kisses with saliva
No longer empty and frantic
Like a cat
Tied to a stick
That's driven into
Frozen winter shit
The ability to laugh at weakness
Calm
Fitter, healthier and more productive
A pig
In a cage
On antibiotics",https://genius.com/Radiohead-fitter-happier-lyrics,"Many people mistook the computerized voice on this track for that of physicist Stephen Hawking.

Counted all my mistakes and there's only one
Standin' out from the list of the things I've done
All the rest of my crimes don't come close
To the look on your face when I let you go
So, I built you a house from a broken home
Then I wrote you a song with the words you spoke
Yeah, it took me some time, but I figured out
How to fix up a heart that I let down
[Chorus: Zayn, 
All

Now, I'm searchin' every lonely place
Every corner, callin' out your name
Tryna find you, but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go?

Yeah, the taste of your lips on the tip of my tongue
Is at the top of the list of the things I want
Mind is runnin' in circles of you and me
Anyone in-between is the enemy
Shadows come with the pain that you're runnin' from
Love was something you never heard enough

Where do broken hearts go?

Down to One Lyrics
[Verse 1]
We were countin' one star at a time
One fell out of the sky
You had your eyes closed, you were wishin' on 'em
I was thinkin' 'bout your lips, girl and kissin' on 'em
We were sittin' in the light of the moon
I was watchin' it shine on you
Funny how time flies with a good girl
On a good night
[Chorus]
We were down to 1 AM
Listenin' to one more song
Thinkin' I want more than just one night out here with you alone
Down to that last Bud Light
In the back of that two-tone half-ton
My heart was tellin' me that one more kiss and I'd be done
Down to one hand in mine
Down to one beautiful smile
I was done with the girl I want
Straight fallin' in love, right there that night
Down to one
[Verse 2]
Said we'd leave in one more minute
One passed by, but we didn't
'Cause you were lookin' like a dream I've been dreamin'
I was thinkin' 'bout anything but leavin'
Still feel that touch
You were in my arms
Soaking up that young love
Never been that far[Chorus]
Down to 1 AM
Listenin' to one more song
Thinkin' I want more than just one night out here with you alone
Down to that last Bud Light
In the back of that two-tone half-ton
My heart was tellin' me that one more kiss and I'd be done
Down to one hand in mine
Down to one beautiful smile
I was done with the girl I want
Straight fallin' in love, right there that night
Down to one
[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge]
I was saying, ""Stay with me
I'll be everything you need""
[Chorus]
We were way past 1 AM
Listenin' to one more song
Thinkin' I want more than just one night out here with you alone
Down to that last Bud Light
In the back of that two-tone half-ton
My heart was tellin' me that one more kiss and I'd be done
Down to one hand in mine
Down to one beautiful smile
I was done with the girl I want
Straight fallin' in love, right there that night

Oh, she's a gold digger
Way over town that digs on me
(Uh)
[Chorus: Kanye West & (Jamie Foxx)]
(She give me money) 
Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said, ""I can tell you rock, I can tell by your charm
Far as girls, you got a flock
I can tell by your charm and your arm""
But I'm lookin' for the one, have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have a ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez,
 
four kids
And I gotta take all they bad asses to ShowBiz?
Okay, get your kids, but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to din' and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl, then you better be paid
You know why? It take too much to touch her
From what I heard, she got a baby by Busta
My best friend said she used to fuck with Usher
I don't care what none of y'all say, I still love her[Chorus: Kanye West & (Jamie Foxx)]
(She give me money) 
Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger, uh
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas, uh

Get down, girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave)
 
Get down, girl, go 'head
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Eighteen years, eighteen years
She got one of your kids, got you for eighteen years
I know somebody payin' child support for one of his kids
His baby mama car and crib is bigger than his
You will see him on TV any given Sunday
Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money
She went to the doctor, got lipo with your money
She walkin' 'round lookin' like Michael with your money
Shoulda got that insured, Geico for your money
If you ain't no punk
Holla, ""We want prenup! We want prenup!"" (Yeah!)
It's somethin' that you need to have
‘Cause when she leave yo' ass, she gon' leave with half
Eighteen years, eighteen years
And on the eighteenth birthday, he found out it wasn't his?[Chorus: Kanye West & (Jamie Foxx)]
(She give me money) 
Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger, uh
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas, uh

Get down, girl, go 'head
[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Now, I ain't sayin' you a gold digger, you got needs
You don't want a dude to smoke, but he can't buy weed
You go out to eat, he can't pay, y'all can't leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
But while y'all washin', watch him
He gon' make it to a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition, baby, look at his eyes
This week, he moppin' floors, next week, it's the fries
So stick by his side
I know there's dudes ballin', and yeah, that's nice
And they gon' keep callin' and tryin', but you stay right, girl
And when he get on, he'll leave yo' ass for a white girl[Refrain: Kanye West & (Jamie Foxx)]

Released as the second single from West's second album, Late Registration, “Gold Digger“ peaked at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 on September 6, 2005, becoming West's and Foxx's second number one single. Co-produced with Jon Brion, the song contains an interpolation of Ray Charles' “I Got a Woman“ by Foxx.

Released as the second single from West's second album, Late Registration, “Gold Digger“ peaked at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 on September 6, 2005, becoming West's and Foxx's second number one single. Co-produced with Jon Brion, the song contains an interpolation of Ray Charles' “I Got a Woman“ by Foxx.

The single broke a record for the most digital downloads in a week, selling over 80,000 digital downloads, and was also the fastest selling digital download of all time; both records have since been broken. It was 2005's second-longest running number one on the Billboard Hot 100 at ten weeks, behind Mariah Carey's “We Belong Together“. “Gold Digger“ was nominated for Record of the Year at the 2006 Grammy Awards (losing to Green Day's “Boulevard of Broken Dreams“) and won the award for Best Rap Solo Performance. The song lists at number 49 on Billboard magazine's All-Time Top 100. The song was voted number 20 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of Hip-Hop.

Upon its release, many surmised that West conceived “Gold Digger“ after watching Jamie Foxx's Oscar-winning portrayal of Ray Charles in the biographical film Ray. However, he had actually recorded the song long before the movie was even developed. West originally produced and recorded the song in Ludacris's home in Atlanta, Georgia for Shawnna's 2004 debut album Worth Tha Weight and had written the chorus from a female first-person viewpoint. However, for reasons unknown, Shawnna passed on the beat. Not wanting to let it go to waste, West decided to write the two verses for the song himself, this time from a male's point-of-view. About a year later, right before ""Gold Digger"" was set to be released, West decided to add a third verse and in a week the new song was recorded and mastered at Sony Music Studios in New York. The idea of employing Jamie Foxx specifically to sing an interpolation of Ray Charles' ""I Got a Woman"" in place of its initial sample did in fact arise from West seeing Ray with his friend John Mayer. Foxx's vocals were recorded over many takes; one version, he sang from start to finish, but the track was retracted as his performance didn't coincide well with the song's instrumentation. After recording another version, Jamie decided to re-record it once more as he felt it contained too many explicit lyrics. Once the track was in place, it was layered with additional instruments provided by Brion and individually selected by West. By the end of their very first studio session together, the pair had completed the basic tracks for final version of ""Gold Digger"".

""Gold Digger"" contains an interpolation of ""I Got a Woman"" by Ray Charles and a bouncy beat formed from handclaps as well as scratches DJ A-Trak. The song also contains a frequent vocal sample from the song ""Bumpin' Bus Stop"" by Thunder and Lightning. Towards the end, the song employs vintage 1970s synthesizers which emit a honking sound in cadence to Kanye's voice. West delivers a tongue-in-cheek lyrical narrative within ""Gold Digger"" in which he critically depicts the disastrous life of a man married to a woman who manipulates him for financial gain. However, another story arises within the third verse, which illustrates a once destitute black male who earns a fortune and decides to leave a loyal, unselfish girlfriend for a white girl.

The song's music video was directed by Hype Williams, who also directed West's previous video, ""Diamonds from Sierra Leone"". Shot in a widescreen letterbox format, using stylized art direction with few props, the video features performances shots of West interspersed with footage of Williams' trademark female video models depicted as ""pin-up"" cover models from fictional vintage magazines. The titles of the magazines the women appear on the cover of reflect the correlating verses in the song. Foxx is also present, lip-synching both his own parts and the Ray Charles vocal sample. John Legend makes a brief cameo. At the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards, ""Gold Digger"" received nominations for both Best Male Video and Best Hip Hop Video, but did not win either of these awards. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Kanye+West/_/Gold+Digger"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Don't have much longer, baby

From his 2019 GQ interview:

”I was living in a hotel, and I remember listening to it and being really nailed to the floor by Stevie Wonder’s interpretation of it. That version moved into my favorite-songs-of-all-time list, right there with Prince’s “When You Were Mine.” I don’t know what creates that feeling of “I have to sing this song.”

Frank appears to be using the “Prisimizer” effect, developed by Francis and the Lights and heard on “Summer Friends” and “All We Got” from Chance The Rapper’s Coloring Book.

Francis confirmed this on Twitter:

”The effect builds a choral harmonization around the vocal track to make it sound like layered vocals. You can see it being used live by Francis and the Lights.” Frank sampled a remix of “Close to You” by The Carpenters. This remix was made by Stevie Wonder and titled “Talkbox Medley (Close To You / Never Can Say)”. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Frank+Ocean/_/close+to+you"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Freezing Lyrics
I find disease
Pick  on someone new
I've  been here before
I've been here with you
You are someone else
Someone  I abused
That  wasn't me
That wasn't you
I  was freezing
It's sunny out there but I am freezing
It's sunny out there and June is just a gift, but I hate this
Find me another lose way
Strong  enough so I beat this
Giving a fuck isn't easy
Throwing up till I am wheezy
You'll find me on a
Broke bridge, bleeding, bruised and broken up
Indulge your hopes
Forget all I know
A party for me
On a table for twoWe were somewhere else
Somewhere I consumed
Believing in me
But I'm on the moon
And I was freezing
It's sunny out there but I am freezing
It's sunny out there and June is just a gift, but I hate this
Find me another lose way
Strong enough so I beat this
Giving a fuck isn't easy
Throwing up till I am wheezy
You'll find me on a
Broke bridge, bleeding, bruiase and broken up",https://genius.com/Peter-cat-recording-co-freezing-lyrics,"",""

[Intro]
Back to you, back to you, back to you
Back to you, back to you, back to you
I go back to you, back to you, back to you every time
[Verse 1]
I get tired of your no-shows
You get tired of my control (Yuh)
They keep telling me to let go
But I don't really let go when I say so (Yuh, yuh)
I keep giving people blank stares (Yuh)
I'm so different when you're not there (Yuh)
It's like something out of Shakespeare
Because I'm really not here when you're not there
[Pre-Chorus]
I've tried to fight our energy
But every time I think I'm free (Yeah)
[Chorus]
You get high and call on the regular
I get weak and fall like a teenager
Why, oh, why does God keep bringing me back to you?
I get drunk, pretend that I'm over it
Self-destruct, show up like an idiot
Why, oh, why does God keep bringing me back to you?[Post-Chorus]
I go back to you, back to you, back to you
Back to you, back to you, back to you
I go back to you, back to you, back to you every time
[Verse 2]
Just when I get on a new wave (Yuh)
Boy, you look at me and I slip outta my lace
They keep calling me a head-case
'Cause I can't make a good case why we can't change
[Pre-Chorus]
I've tried to fight our energy (Yee)
But every time I think I'm free (Yeah)
[Chorus]
You get high and call on the regular
I get weak and fall like a teenager
Why, oh, why does God keep bringing me (Mm) back to you? (Back to you, baby)
I get drunk, pretend that I'm over it
Self-destruct, show up like an idiot
Why, oh, why does God keep bringing me back to you?
[Post-Chorus]
I go back to you, back to you, back to you (I go back to you)
Back to you, back to you, back to you (Back to you)
I go back to you, back to you, back to you every time (I go)

[Verse 1]
Little freak, Jezebel
You sit high atop the kitchen counter
Stay green a little while
You bring blue lights to dreams
Starry haze, crystal ball
Somehow, you've become some paranoia
A wet dream just dangling
But your gift is wasted on me
[Chorus]
I was thinkin' about who you are
Your delicate point of view
I was thinkin' about you
I'm not worried about where you are
Or who you will go home to
I'm just thinkin' about you
Just thinkin' about you
[Verse 2]
Did you dress up for Halloween?
I spilled beer on your friend, I'm not sorry
A golf swing and a trampoline
Maybe we'll do this again
Tracksuit and a ponytail
You hide the body all that yoga gave you
Red wine and a ginger ale
But you would make fun of me, for sure[Chorus]
I was thinkin' about who you are
Your delicate point of view
I was thinkin' about you
I'm not worried about where you are
Or who you will go home to
I'm just thinkin' about you
[Verse 3]
I disrespected you
Jumped in feet first and I landed too hard
A broken ankle, karma rules
You never saw my birthmark
[Chorus]
I was thinkin' about who you are
Your delicate point of view
I was thinkin' about you
I'm not worried about where you are
Or who you will go home to
I'm just thinkin' about you

[Verse]
Breathin' gets so hard for me now
It's speedin' up and slowin' back down
When did breathin' get so hard under the moonlight?
If you're hearing this, I hope that you're proud
Can't even count how many times I let you down
If there's a God or there's a sign, it's time that you send it out

And, oh, my love, you bring me back to default
The more I spill it out
You bring me down to such a deep hole, honey (Oh)

But don't you be scared

It's been way long overdue
Just like these inches down my back
Usually don't let people touch it

Spend my dimes and spend my time

But I don't care, mmm

To the Moon and Back Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Through the dirt and the gravel
Through the years and the miles
Every road that you traveled
Through the tears and the smiles
Through the clear and the muddy
Through the thick and thin
The quiet nights, the howling wind
Through the good and the ugly
The blue and the black
To the ends of the Earth
To the moon and back
[Verse 2]
Through all of the words
The mean and the kind
Through the strings that unravel
And the ties that bind
From the crazy and the different
To the more of the same
From the coast is clear
To a hurricane
Yeah, I'll be right beside you
On a roll or off the tracks
To the ends of the Earth
To the moon and back
To the moon and back[Verse 3]
Through the bitter and the sweet
The cold and the fire
Lonely cotton sheets
And the burning desire
Until our song is over
Til the stars all fade to black
I'm gonna love you
To the ends of the Earth
To the moon and back
Yeah, I'm gonna love you
All the way to the moon and back

Givin the Dog a Bone Lyrics
This is the fourth track off of AC/DC’s Back In Black album, in which the singer tells a tale of receiving oral sex form a woman – utilizing the metaphor of just giving the dog a bone…clever.
[Intro]
Ooh, ayy, yeah
[Verse 1]
She take you down easy
Goin' down to her knees
Goin' down to the devil
Down, down to ninety degrees
Ah, she blowin' me crazy
'Til my ammunition is dry
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, she's usin' her head again
She's usin' her head
Oh, she's usin' her head again
[Chorus]
I'm just a-givin' the dog a bone (
Givin' the dog a bone
)
Yeah, I'm givin' the dog a bone (
Givin' the dog a bone
)
I'm just a-givin' the dog a bone (
Givin' the dog a bone
)
I'm just a-givin' the dog a bone (
Givin' the dog a bone
), woah
[Verse 2]
Oh, she's no Mona Lisa
No, she's no Playboy star
But she'd send you to Heaven
Then explode you to Mars[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, she's usin' her head again (
Usin' her head again
)
She's usin' her head (
Usin' her head again
)
Oh, she's usin' her head again (
Usin' her head

Build Me a Daddy Lyrics
[Verse 1]
A boy walks past a window of a glowin' open sign
Full of wooden toys and trucks and painted trains
Rings a bell up on the counter, hands a picture to the man
Of a kid beside a soldier smiling away
Said, ""Sir, I've heard you can build anything""
[Chorus]
Could you build me a daddy?
Strong as Superman
Make him ten feet tall with a southern drawl
And a crooked smile if you can
'Cause I sure miss him
Maybe you could bring him back
If I walked in with him, it'd sure make mama happy
If you could build me a daddy
[Verse 2]
There's an old Winchester rifle, back home hangin' on the wall
He promised me he'd teach me how to aim
And he said when I got older, we could work on that curveball
I know he'd never wanna miss a game
So here's a little money that I've saved
[Chorus]
Could you build me a daddy?
Strong as Superman
Make him ten feet tall with a southern drawl
And a crooked smile if you can
I sure miss him
Maybe you could bring him back
If I walked in with him, it'd sure make mama happy
If you could build me a daddy[Bridge]
Give him a big heart, make his arms wide open
I know he misses me, so mister, I was hopin'
[Chorus]
You could build me a daddy
Strong as Superman
Make him ten feet tall with a southern drawl
And a fishing pole in his hand
'Cause I sure miss him
Maybe you could bring him back?
If I walked in with him, it'd sure make my mama happy
If you could you build me a daddy

Common love isn't for us

""Physical"" is a song by the English Albanian singer Dua Lipa It was released on 30 January 2020, through Warner Records on digital platforms globally and contemporary hit radio in the United Kingdom. It appears as the fourth track of her second studio album Future Nostalgia, and it's second single.

The track features a chugging synth bassline, drums and various percussion instruments. Lipa uses a spoken word delivery in the prechorus, but belts and chants the chorus, which includes a reference to Olivia Newton-John's 1981 song of the same name. The lyrics describe the excitement of falling in love.

It was written by Lipa, Clarence Coffee Jr, Sarah Hudson and its producer Jason Evigan and Koz. The group had previously worked together on New Rules, the sixth single from her debut studio album. Lipa felt that the release of the song was a ""natural"" choice that would allow her to start a new chapter in her life, and chose it to be the second single from Future Nostalgia.

The music video was released in the next day, by the Catalan director Lope Serrano, who conceived the video under his company CANADA, along with his partner Nicolás Méndez.

""Well, diversity was for sure very intentional. [...] At the end, the idea is that all the colours (concepts) break their chromatic group obedience and meet together in a purely human celebration of lust and freedom and eclecticism. [...] This results in a single concept forming the nucleus of the map, the centre of existence: ORGASM. [...]  Orgasm is the physical peak of being alive! [...] Well, for me it’s a song about a genuine desire for human contact. It’s a sexy track that drives you magnetically to a climax (let’s get physical!). At the same time, the song has an increasing trajectory. The recurrent verses are repeated six times in the second half of the song as a crescendo, the same way it happens in real life with sexual arousal. [...]

– Via i-D

Physical reached #2 on the Bulgaria and Ireland Singles chart, #3 on the UK Singles, and #60 on the Billboard 200. It is certified 2x PLATINUM in the UK and PLATINUM in the US, has over 1.03B streams on Spotify and 472 MILLION views on Youtube! <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Dua+Lipa/_/Physical"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Bad Reputation Lyrics
On “Bad Reputation”, Shawn reveals his love for a girl despite her having a bad reputation.  As he’s speaking to her, he displays that he’s committed to her no matter what is said about her.
[Verse 1]
She got a bad reputation
She takes the long way home
And all of my friends seen her naked
Or so the story goes
Mistakes, we all make them
But they won't let it go, oh, no
'Cause she's got a bad reputation
But I know what they don't
[Chorus]
And I don't care what they say about you, baby
They don't know what you've been through
Trust me, I could be the one to treat you like a lady
Let me see what's underneath
All I need is you
[Verse 2]
She got a bad reputation
Nobody gets too close
A sight of a soul when it's breakin'
Makin' my heart grow cold
And into the deeper, she's sinkin'
I'm beggin' her please, don't let go
She's got a bad reputation
But she's all that, all I want, though, mm, yeah[Chorus]
And I don't care what they say about you, baby
They don't know what you've been through
And trust me, I could be the one to treat you like a lady
Let me see what's underneath
All I need is you
[Bridge]
Nobody knows the way that I know her, said
Nobody knows the weight that’s on her shoulders, said
Nobody knows the way that I know her, said
She got it bad, she got it bad
Nobody knows the way that I know her, said
Nobody knows the weight that’s on her shoulders, said
Nobody knows the way that I know her, said
She got it bad, she got it bad
[Chorus]
And I don't care what they say about you, baby
They don't know what you've been through
Trust me, I could be the one to treat you like a lady
Let me see what's underneath
All I need is you
And I don't care what they say about you, baby
They don't know what you've been through

Driving me crazy, but I'm into it (Ah)
But I'm into it (Ah), I'm kinda into it
It's getting crazy, I think I'm losing it
I think I'm losing it, oh, I think she said
[Chorus]
""I'm having your baby"" (Hey!)
""It's none of your business"" (Oh!)
""I'm having your baby"" (Hey!)
""It's none of your business"" (Hey! Hey) (It's none of your, it's none of your—)

[Post-Chorus]
Ow!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Ah, la-la-la-la-la
[Verse 3]
She sits beside me like a silhouette
Hard candy drippin' on me till my feet are wet
And now she's all over me, it's like I paid for it (Cha-ching!)
It's like I paid for it, I'm gonna pay for this (Oh!)[Chorus]
It's none of your, it's none of your—
""I'm having your baby"" (Hey!)
""It's none of your business""
""I'm having your baby"" (Hey!)
""It's none of your business"" (It's none of your, none of your—)

Fans assumed it was “Kiwi” as he was handing out slices of kiwi fruit to promote his appearance. However, it turned out it to be a shortened version of “Ever Since New York”.

In a May 12 interview with BBC Radio 1, Harry explained the song:

""It started out as a joke, now it’s one of my favorite songs. It’s one of the first ones I wrote for the album, when I was getting out a lot of energy. I hadn’t written in a long time and this is what came out of it.""

Given the song’s lyrics, some theories about an actress from New Zealand have arisen. However, NZ has always been special for the members of One Direction. Harry even has a tattoo of the NZ national emblem, the silver fern, on his arm. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Harry+Styles/_/kiWi"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

I could've took the pain and I could've went out sad
Streets stepped in and raised me, but I ain't have my daddy
Niggas tryna clone me, run off with my swag
From sellin' coco, got Chanel on my jacket (Jacket)
Shawty give me mop with the less, it don't last (Last)
Takin' more drugs all alone in a mansion (All alone)

""Twist and Shout"" was the last song recorded; producer George Martin knew John Lennon's voice would suffer from the performance, so he left it until last, with only 15 minutes of scheduled recording time remaining for the album.
Lennon was suffering from a cold, and was drinking milk and sucking on cough drops to soothe his throat. His coughing is audible on the album, and the cold's effect on his voice is audible in this recording. Even so, he produced a memorable vocal performance, a raucous, dynamic rocker. He later said his voice was not the same for a long time afterward, and that ""every time [he] swallowed, it felt like sandpaper.""
They tried for a second take, but Lennon had nothing left and it was abandoned. George Martin said, ""I did try a second take ... but John's voice had gone.""

What Up Gangsta Lyrics
[Intro]
G-Unit (Buck), we in here (Buck)
We could get the drama poppin', we don't care (Buck, buck, buck)
It's going down (Buck), 'cause I'm around (Buck)
50 Cent, you know how I gets down (Down)
[Chorus]
What up, blood? (What?) What up, cuz? (What?)
What up, blood? (What?) What up, gangsta?
What up, blood? (What?) What up, cuz? (What?)
What up, blood? (What?) What up, gangsta?
[Verse 1]
They say I walk around like I got a S on my chest
Nah, that's a semi-auto and a vest on my chest
I try not to say nothin' the DA might wanna play in court
But I'll hunt a duck nigga down like it's a sport
Front on me, I'll cut you, gun-butt you or buck you
You gettin' money, I can't get none with ya, then fuck ya
I'm not the type to get knocked for DWI
I'm the type that'll kill your connect when the coke price rise
Gangstas, they bump my shit, them, they know me
I grew up around some niggas that's not my homies
Hundred Gs, I stash it (What?), the MAC, I blast it (Yeah)
Ds come, we dump the diesel in battery acid
This flow's been mastered,
 the ice, I flash it
Jux me, I'll have your mama picking out your casket, bastard
I'm on the next level, Breitling baguette bezel
Benz pedal to the metal, hotter than a tea kettle[Chorus]
Blood (What?), what up, cuz? (What?)
What up, blood? (What?) What up, gangsta?
What up, blood? (What?) What up, cuz? (What?)
What up, blood? (What?) What up, gangsta?
[Bridge]
We don't play that, we don't play that
We don't play that (G-Unit), we don't play around
[Verse 2]
I sit back, twist the best bud, burn and wonder
When gangstas bump my shit, can they hear my hunger?
When the fifth kick, duck quick, it sound like thunder
In December, I'll make your block feel like summer
The rap critics say I can rhyme, the fiends say my dope is a nine
Every chick I fuck with is a dime
I'm like Patti LaBelle, homie, I'm on my own
Where I lay my hat's my home, I'm a rolling stone
Cross my path, I'll crush ya, thinking I won't touch ya
I'll have your ass using a wheelchair, cane, or crutches
Industry hoes fuck us, in the hood, they love us
Stomp a bone out your ass with some brand new Chukkas
[Chorus]
What up, blood? (What?) What up, cuz? (What?)
What up, blood? (What?) What up, gangsta?
What up, blood? (What?) What up, cuz? (What?)
What up, blood? (What?) What up, gangsta?[Outro]
We don't play that, we don't play that
We don't play that (G-Unit), we don't play around
We don't play that, we don't play that
We don't play that (G-Unit), we don't play around
We don't play that, we don't play that

[Verse 1]
Ten times out of nine, I know you're lying
But nine times out of ten, I know you're trying
So I'm trying to be fair
And you're trying to be there and to care
And you're caught up in your permanent emotions
And all the loving I've been giving goes unnoticed
It's just floating in the air, lookie there
Are you aware
[Pre-Chorus]
You're my lifeline, are you tryna kill me?
If I wasn't me, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty enough?
I don't care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, skin thick, too tough, mmm
[Chorus]
'Cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain
You, you, you, you and me could calm a war down
You, you, you, you and me could make it rain now
You, you, you, you and me could stop this love drought
[Verse 2]
Nine times out of ten, I'm in my feelings
But ten times out of nine, I'm only human
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Feel like that question has been posed, I'm movin' on
I always been committed, I been focused
I always paid attention, been devoted
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Oh, already asked that, my bad[Pre-Chorus]
But you my lifeline, think you tryna kill me
If I wasn't B, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty enough?

Don’t Push Me Lyrics
Second track on Get Rich or Die Tryin' to feature Eminem with the addition of G-Unit young gun Lloyd Banks.
[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I need you to pray for me and
I need you to care for me and
I need you to want me to win
I need to know where I'm heading, 'cause I know where I've been
The flow is bone crushing, it's nothing, I come up with something
Come through your strip frontin', stuntin', it's something you want
745, chrome spinners
, haters hate that I'm winning
Man, I've been hot from the beginning
Motherfuckers envy the kid, control your jealousy
'Cause I can't control my temper, I'm finna catch a felony
Pistol in hand, homie, I'm down to get it poppin'
Once I squeeze the first shot, you know I ain't stoppin'
'Til my clip is empty, I'm simply
Not that nigga you should try your luck with or fuck with
Hollow tip shells struck you with your bones broken, guns smoking, still locing
What, nigga? Lay your ass down, paramedics get you up feeling
[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Right now I'm on the edge, so don't push me
I aim straight for your head, so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead, so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy
Right now I'm on the edge, so don't push me
I aim straight for your head, so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead, so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
I done lost my bigger nigga and I didn't cry
Too young to understand the consequences of a man living a lie
I gotta get that money
, I'll be damned if I'm bummy
Gotta watch my back around these niggas 'cause they funny
Twenty years of watching my mama tears got me heated, heavily weeded
Smoking that bong 'cause I need it
These niggas don't want me balling, they want me buried
Bogged in the dirt from shots flurried
Laying with bugs under my shirt
I got plans to hop up in that Hummer, 'cause I'm a stunner
I sit back and wonder when them angels gon' call my number
Under my chest is a heart of a lion, I ain't lyin'
Bounty hunters got me flying with my iron, high as a giant
I'm running from nothing, my stomach is touching what I'm clutching
To give you more than a concussion, end of discussion
My blood is colder so I'm bolder, Hennessy and soda
Hood on my shoulder, 
look in the mirror, I see a soldier
[Chorus: 50 Cent & 
Eminem
]
Right now I'm on the edge, so don't push me
I aim straight for your head, so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead, so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy
Right now I'm on the edge, so don't push me
I aim straight for your head, so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead, so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy
 (
Em, drop that shit, c'mon
)[Verse 3: Eminem]
These are my ideas, this is my sweat and tears
This is shit that I saw with my eyeballs, my ears
 (What else?)
This is me, who's gotta be what you see on TV
What you hear on CD, what appears easy (What else?)
Man these teenie boppers see me on these magazine covers
In these beanies and these rags living fantasies, frontin' (C'mon)
Like it's all fun and games 'til they shoot 'em up bang
And you see your brains hang and you see we ain't playing
Ain't saying we ain't laying down at night and ain't praying
I bullied my way in this game, man, I'm done playing
Man, I'm done saying that I'm done playing
I'ma start laying into these motherfucking cocksuckers
 (C'mon)
There's no way I'ma back down like a goddamn coward, I can't
How would I look as a man bowing to his knees?
Like the mad cow disease, let somebody lash out at me
And not lash back out at 'em, please
Oh, woah, yo, ho
Hold up, oh no, not me, not Marshall
You wanna see Marshall? I'll show you martial
I try to show you art, but you just pick it apart
So I see I have to start showing you fucking old farts
A whole 'nother side I wanted to not show you (C'mon)
So you know you're not dealing with some fucking marshmallow
Little soft yellow, punk pussy, whose heart's Jell-O 'cause[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Right now I'm on the edge, so don't push me
I aim straight for your head, so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead, so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy
Right now I'm on the edge, so don't push me
I aim straight for your head, so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead, so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy

[Verse 1]
I said, ""Remember this moment""
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age
[Chorus]
Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the 
pretenders
One day, we will be remembered
[Verse 2]
I said, ""Remember this feeling""
I pass the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, ""This is absurd""
'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world[Chorus]
Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, ""Long live that look on your face""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered
[Bridge]
Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall
Will you take a moment? Promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
But if, God forbid, fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please, tell 'em my name
Tell 'em how the crowds went wild
Tell 'em how I hope they shine
Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you[Chorus]
Long, long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
Singing, ""Long live all the mountains we moved""
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
And long, long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders

""Long Live"" is about how I feel reflecting on it. This song for me is like looking at a photo album of all the award shows, and all the stadium shows, and all the hands in the air in the crowd.

We raise our glasses, the madness
The tiny waist, the asses, dancin' in trances
Baby say she ready and we 'bout to find out
Don't be mad that your girl done found 'bout
And we get it
Never lied, rager-fied, on a mission
And they lookin' like they know, but they didn't
Let me slip into my mode, I slip round the notes

Roses Lyrics
Around the time that Late Registration came out, Kanye West’s grandmother had a near death experience.

This song samples “Rosie” by Bill Withers
[Produced by Kanye West and Jon Brion]
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I know it's past visitin' hours
But can I please give her these flowers?
The doctor don't wanna take procedures
He claim her heart can't take the anesthesia
It'll send her body into a seizure
That lil' thing by the hospital bed, it'll stop beepin'
Hey, chick, I'm at a loss for words
What do you say at this time? Remember when I was nine?
Tell her everything gon' be fine, but I be lyin'
Her family cryin', they want her to live, and she tryin'
I'm arguin', like, ""What kind of doctor can we fly in?""
You know the best medicine go to people that's paid
If Magic Johnson got a cure for AIDS
And all the broke motherfuckers passed away
You tellin' me if my grandma's in the NBA
Right now, she'd be okay?
But since she was just a secretary
Working for the church for 35 years
Things 'sposed to stop right here?
My grandfather tryin' to pull it together, he strong
That's where I get my confidence from
I asked the nurse, ""Did you do the research?""
She asked me, ""Can you sign some t-shirts?""
""Bitch, is you smokin' reefer?
You don't see that we hurt?"" But still–[Hook: Bill Withers & 
Tony Williams

I smile
When roses come to see me
And I can't wait for a sunny day (
Seeing it through your eyes
)
Can't wait for the clouds to break
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
They outside of the emergency room, room
You can feel my heartbeat, beat, beat
If she gon' pull through, we gon' find out soon
But right now, she 'sleep, sleep, sleep
My momma say they say she could pass away any day
Hey, chick, what these doctors know anyway?
Let me see the X-rays, I ain't no expert, I'm just hurt
Cousin Kim took off of work
Plus, my Aunt Shirley, Aunt Beverly, Aunt Klaye and Aunt Jean
So many aunties we could have an Auntie Team
Feel like Amerie, it's this ""1 Thing""
When they said that she made it, you see they eyes gleam
I think we at an all-time high
To get there, we run, we fly, we drive
'Cause with my family, we know where home is
So instead of sending flowers, we the roses

Last Thing I Needed, First Thing This Morning Lyrics
[Verse 1]
The postman delivered, a ""past due"" bill notice
The alarm clock rang two hours late
The garbage man left all the trash on the sidewalk
And the hinges fell off of the gate
And this morning at breakfast, I spilled all the coffee
And opened the door on my knee
[Refrain]
Oh, the last thing I needed, the first thing this morning
Was to have you walk out on me
[Verse 2]
Last night you came home late, and I knew you'd been drinking
By that old mellow look on your face
And I thought, ""It don't matter, 'cause it's the holiday season""
And you fill such a big empty space
And I laid down beside you, and I wanted your loving
'Cause your love makes my life complete
[Refrain]
Oh, the last thing I needed, the first thing this morning
Was to have you walk out on me
[Verse 3]
So excuse me for looking, like my world just ended
And excuse me for looking, like I just lost my best friend
And excuse me for loving, and being forgiving
So just go on if you want to be free[Refrain / Outro]
The last thing I needed, the first thing this morning
Was to have you walk out on me

I would be fatal
[Verse 1]
I
'm writing this letter to let you know I'm really leaving
And no, I'm not keeping your shit
Heard you got some new homies, got some new hobbies
Even a new ho too
Maybe she can come help you
Maybe she can come lick you
After we're done, what's done is done
I don't want nothing else to do with it
Let me tell you a secret
I've been secretly banging your homeboy
Why you in Vegas all up on Valentine's Day?
Why am I so easy to forget like that?
It can't be that easy for you to get like that
Oh, no, she didn't, ooh, yes, I did
Oh, no, she didn't, I'll do it again

Leave me lonely for prettier women
You know I need too much attention for shit like that
You know you wrong for shit like that
I could be your supermodel if you believe

I don't see myself
Why I can't stay alone just by myself?
Wish I was comfortable just with myself
But I need you, but I need you, but I need you[Verse 2]
""Ooh, just get a load of them, they got chemistry""
All they could say, we like brother and sister
Look so good together
Bet they fuckin' for real, and they was right
That's why I stayed with ya, the, the dick was too good
It made me feel good for temporary love
You was a temporary lover

That’s My Kind of Night Lyrics
Luke Bryan’s second single from 2013’s ‘Crash My Party’ chronicles his ideal night with a lady friend, and peaked #1 on Billboard’s US Country Songs and #16 on Billboard’s Top 100.
[Intro]
Uh, uh
[Verse 1]
I got that real good, feel good stuff
Up under the seat of my big black jacked up truck
Rollin' on 35's
, pretty girl by my side
You got that sun tan skirt and boots
Waiting on you to look my way and scoot
Your little hot self over here
Girl, hand me another beer, yeah
[Chorus]
All them other boys want to wine you up and take you downtown
But you look like the kind that likes to take it way out
Out where the corn rows grow, row, row my boat
Floatin' down the Flint River, catch us up a little catfish dinner
Going to sound like a winner, winner, when I lay you down and love you right
Yeah, that's my kind of night
[Verse 2]
Might sit down on my diamond plate tailgate
Put in my country-rock, hip-hop mixtape
Little Conway, a little T-Pain, might just make it rain
You can hang your t-shirt on a limb
Hit that bank and we can ease on in
Soak us up a little moonlight
You know I know what you like, yeah[Chorus]
All them other boys want to wine you up and take you downtown
But you look like the kind that likes to take it way out
Out where the corn rows grow, row, row my boat
Floatin' down the Flint River, catch us up a little catfish dinner
Going to sound like a winner, winner, when I lay you down and love you right
Yeah, that’s my kind of night
Yeah, that’s my kind of night
[Bridge]
My kinda-- your kind-- is this kind of night
We dance in the dark and your lips land on mine
Oh oh oh oh oh, gonna get our love on
Oh oh oh oh oh, time to get our buzz on
[Chorus]
All them other boys want to wine you up and take you downtown
But you look like the kind that likes to take it way out
Out where the corn rows grow, row, row my boat
Floatin' down the Flint River, catch us up a little catfish dinner
Going to sound like a winner, winner, when I lay you down and love you right
Yeah, that’s my kind of night

[Verse 1]
Feeling the reminisce
Gone in an instance
Blink of an eye
No goodbye
I had a notion
Deep as the ocean
Blue like the sky
Oh my
[Pre-Chorus]
Like a permanent stain
Wishing I could just wash away, away
Hate our love was in vein
But we're the blame
For all the pain
For all the pain

If I would have known
It could have been you

Your enemy, no, no
But if I

If I would have known

There repercussion
Of missing your loving
Haunts me at night
The ghosts are alive
All of the memories
Of serenity
Dwindle in my mind
All the time

Like a permanent stain
Wishing I could just wash away, away
Hate our love was in vein
Who was to blame
For all the pain
For all the pain

If I would have known

It could have been you

[Intro: Shangela Laquifa Wadley]
This is one small step for woman
One giant leap for woman-kind
[Verse 1]
I'd rather be alone tonight
You can say ""I love you"" through the phone tonight
Really don’t wanna be in your arms tonight
I'll just use my covers to stay warm tonight
Think I'm better off here all alone tonight
Ain’t no checkin' on when I get home tonight
Just makin' sure I'm good on my own tonight
Even though there isn't nothin' wrong tonight
[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I'm just sayin', baby
I can’t really miss you if I’m with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
It’s like I'm the universe and you be N-A-S-A
[Chorus]
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I’ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)[Verse 2]
Bottom line
Usually, I would love it if you stayed the night
I just think I'm on another page tonight
It ain't nothing wrong with saying I need me time
Usually, I would orbit around you
But gravity seems to be the only thing that's pulling me
You'll be my rise and shine soon as them stars align, mmm
[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I can't really miss you if I'm with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
It's like I'm the universe and you be N-A-S-A
[Chorus]
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)
[Bridge]
You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover
Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under
You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover
(You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover)
Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under
(Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under)[Outro]

Commercially, it reached the top 20 in Greece, Australia, Canada, Malaysia, Singapore, and the United States.

It was released on February 8, 2019 through Republic Records. It was written by Grande, Victoria Monét, Tayla Parx, and its producers Tommy Brown and Charles Anderson.

Commercially, it reached the top 20 in Greece, Australia, Canada, Malaysia, Singapore, and the United States.

The track features a spoken introduction by Shangela, an American drag queen. She says, ""One small step for woman, one giant leap for womankind"", a variation on Neil Armstrong's quote, ""That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.""

""NASA"" was ranked as one of the best songs of 2019 by several publications. Pitchfork stated that ""on an album largely about the joys of being unattached, ""NASA"" offers a nuance: the freedom to be attached, just not right now. “I can’t really miss you if I’m with you,” Grande offers, gently reminding a lover that intimacy doesn’t mean constant proximity. While Grande’s refrain of “I’m a star, I’ma need space” verges on cutesy, the delicate harmonies and airy production of “NASA” make its blown-out bass and trap drums feel weightless."" Rolling Stone said the song was ""a deeply empathetic (and devastatingly catchy) ode to wanting to be alone and letting absence make hearts grow fonder. The beat, courtesy of producers Tommy Brown and Charles Anderson, is the standout on an album with stiff competition, based around a whistling, underwater-sounding synth. The writing, which took place in a marathon New York recording run, is some of Grande’s sharpest to date. And on top of all that, the song’s basic thesis is correct: If you haven’t listened to it in a while, throw it on right now. You’ll like it even more than you used to."" Uproxx ranked 'NASA' at number 18 on their year-end list, saying that ""more songs about self-sufficiency within relationships can only be a good thing for Ariana’s young fans, and those of still floundering through codependency issues in our thirties."" Stereogum ranked it at number 19 on their Top 40 Pop Songs of 2019 list.
Shangela has said of the origins of her contribution to the track:

[Verse 1]
Tell me why you gotta look at me that way
You know what it does to me
So, baby, what you tryna say? Ayy
Lately, all I want is you on top of me
You know where your hands should be
So, baby, won't you come show me? Mm
I got you, I got you dreamin' (Ah)
You close your eyes and you're screamin' (Ah)
Play with your mind for no reason
I know you love how I tease it (Ah-ah)
You know that I'm playin', so don't be mistaken
You already know what I'm thinkin', boy
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, why'd you have to be so cute?
It's impossible to ignore you, woah
Why must you make me laugh so much?
It's bad enough we get along so well
[Chorus]
Just say goodnight and go
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Just say goodnight and go
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Just say goodnight and go[Verse 2]
One of these days
You'll miss your train and come stay with me
(It's always say goodnight and go)
We'll have drinks and talk about things
And any excuse to stay awake with you
And you'd sleep here, I'd sleep there
But then the heating may be down again
(At my convenience)
We'd be good, we'd be great together
[Pre-Chorus]
Why'd you have to be so cute?
It's impossible to ignore you, woah
Why must you make me laugh so much?
It's bad enough we get along so well
[Chorus]
Just say goodnight and go
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Just say goodnight and go (I know how you want it, baby, just like this)
Ooh (Know you're thinkin' 'bout it, baby, just one kiss)
Ooh (While you're lookin' at 'em, baby, read my lips)
Ooh (I know what you want, but you can't have this)

It was written by Grande and Victoria Monét along with its producers Tommy Brown, Social House's Charles Anderson and Michael Foster. In terms of music ""Goodnight n Go"" is an EDM and future bass song that contains trap and deep house elements.

Prior to recording the song, Grande had expressed admiration for Imogen Heap's music, citing her as a musical inspiration. Heap told Billboard, in 2018, ""I think for her 21st birthday — her mom emailed me somehow and asked, 'Can Ariana come over for dinner?' So she came to my house in the middle of the countryside in the outskirts of London."" The two made a vegan dinner (Grande is vegan) and experimented with Heap's musical technology and devices.

Heap responded positively to the cover/remix, calling it ""a gift"", telling Billboard magazine, ""...[Grande] kept tweeting about it and people were like, 'Are you going to do a cover of 'Goodnight and Go' on Twitter?' Her brother Frankie Grande sent me a text with the song, and I heard it and thought it was really great. I loved it. I'm so happy — I'm smiling now. It feels like a gift when somebody that famous picks up on a song that has had its day and gives it a second life, it's a real gift. I think she's done a lovely version of it. I love that saucy verse she's put in there and twisted it up at the end. What's not to like? ...one song on her album is like ten of my albums, so it's pretty cool. It's like a gift."" <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Ariana+Grande/_/Goodnight+n+Go"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

And fall off the table, get swept under

Throw your keys in the bowl

​keep lookin’ up Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Grew up in the sticks where there ain't no light
But the stars were big and bright
If they told me no, I would always wonder why
But I tried to be good and keep my head down
But there was too much sky around
And my daddy said
[Chorus]
""Keep lookin' up
Don't let the world bring you down
Keep your head in the clouds
And your feet on the ground""
Keep lookin' up
Keep lookin' up
[Verse 2]
They come to me in different ways
Beautiful and strange
I've seen fire burning in the sky
Things that I can't explain
I've seen truth step into the light
And true love turn into pain

But I keep lookin' up
Won't let the world bring me down
Keep your head in thе clouds
And your feet on the ground
Keep lookin' up
Keep lookin' up
Keep lookin' up
Keep lookin' up[Bridge]

I'vе seen strange things happen all the time

She's got tickets to her own show
But nobody wants to go
And I'm stuck sitting in the front row
I'm singing along like there's no tomorrow
[Verse 1]
It's funny how you say that you made it on your own
When you haven't worked for anyone your daddy didn't know
You say you got a job, but I don't know what you do
Such a fu-fu-fucking snob that you'll never know the truth
[Pre-Chorus]
You're perfect on the outside, but nothing at the core
It's easy to forget when you show up at my door
Stop messing with my mind, 'cause you'll never have my heart
But your perfect little body ma-ma-makes me fall apart
Your perfect little body ma-ma-makes me fall apart

She's got tickets to her own show
But nobody wants to go
And I'm stuck sitting in the front row
I'm singing along like there's no tomorrow

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la[Verse 2]
I know you wanna stay, but I think that you should go
Cause you got nothing to say, you just sit there on your phone
I try not to give in, but temptation has me lost
So I will do my best to ge-ge-ge-ge-get you off
[Pre-Chorus]
You're perfect on the outside, but nothing at the core
It's easy to forget when you show up at my door
Stop messing with my mind, 'cause you'll never have my heart

Mistake Lyrics
On “Mistake”, Demi sings about leaving someone who wasn’t good for them at all.

Even though the song wasn’t released as a single, it managed to peak at #91 on the South Korea Gaon Chart.
[Verse 1]
Now that I'm thinking sober
Don't you try to get no closer
I'm just gonna get in my car and drive, and drive
Looking in the rear view mirror
Everything is so much clearer
Watch me wave it all goodbye, goodbye
[Pre-Chorus 1]
The lights flashing, giving me all the danger signs
Someone to save, to save, but it don't work that way
[Chorus]
Think you made your greatest mistake
I'm not gonna call this a break
Think you really blew it this time
Think you could walk on such a thin line
Won't be taking your midnight calls
Ignore the rocks you throw at my wall
I see it written on your face
You know you made it, your greatest mistake
(Your greatest mistake, your greatest mistake, your greatest mistake)
[Verse 2]
When the last straw is broken
When the last door is closing
I ain't that dumb to stick around, stick around
I ain't got the time for looking back
When you let yourself slip through the cracks
And you just keep going down, down, down[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'ma stay undercover
Lay low, need some time
No one to save, to save
This sick cycle’s over, babe
[Chorus]
Think you made your greatest mistake
I'm not gonna call this a break
Think you really blew it this time
Think you could walk on such a thin line
Won't be taking your midnight calls
Ignore the rocks you throw at my wall
I see it written on your face
You know you made it, your greatest mistake (Ooh-oh)
[Bridge]
Why you looking at me, spitting the same old line?
Tryna creep back, ain't no flipping my mind
Don't you get it by now? The story's over, over
Still calling my name outside my house
I'm hitting the switch, watch the lights go out
Watch the lights go out
[Breakdown]
I hope you ache, ache, ache, oh-oh, oh
I hope you ache, ache, ache, ah-oh, oh, yeah-yeah-yeah[Chorus]
Think you made your greatest mistake (Mistake)
I'm not gonna call this a break
Think you really blew it this time
Think you could walk on such a thin line
Won't be taking your midnight calls
Ignore the rocks you throw at my wall
I see it written on your face
You know you made it, your greatest mistake

Continuing a major theme on the album, Frank evokes the lux and glamorous like no other (see “Sweet Life” and “Lost”). Only “Super Rich Kids” is a bit more harrowing—there’s something sad, something hopeless…

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms
The maids come around too much
Parents ain't around enough
Too many joy rides in daddy's Jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothin' but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothin' but fake friends
[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
Start my day up on the roof
There's nothing like this type of view
Point the clicker at the tube
I prefer expensive news
New car, new girl, new ice, new glass
New watch, good times, babe, it's good times, yeah
She wash my back three times a day
This shower head feels so amazin'
We'll both be high, the help don't stare
They just walk by, they must don't care
A million one, a million two
A hundred more will never do

Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms

Parents ain't around enough

Super rich kids with nothin' but fake friends[Post-Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Real love
I'm searchin' for a real love
Oh, real love
I'm searchin' for a real love
Oh, real love
[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
Alright, close your eyes for what you can't imagine
We are the Xanny-gnashin',
 
Caddy-smashin' bratty ass
He mad, he snatched his daddy's Jag and used the shit for batting practice
Adamant and he thrashin'
Purchasing crappy grams with half the hand of cash you handed
Panic and patch me up
Pappy done latch-keyed us
Toyin' with Raggy Anns, and mammy done had enough
Brash as fuck, breachin' all these aqueducts
Don't believe us, treat us like we can't erupt, yeah
[Verse 3: Frank Ocean]
We end our day up on the roof
I say I'll jump, I never do
But when I'm drunk, I act a fool
Talkin' 'bout, do they sew wings on tailored suits?
I'm on that ledge, she grabs my arm
She slaps my head, it's good times, yeah
Sleeve rips off, I slip, I fall
The market's down like sixty stories
And some don't end the way they should
My silver spoon has fed me good
A million one, a million cash
Close my eyes and feel the crash[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms (Ah)
The maids come around too much
Parents ain't around enough (Uh-uh, uh)
Too many joy rides in daddy's Jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothin' but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothin' but fake friends
[Post-Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Real love (Ain't that somethin' rare?)
I'm searchin' for a real love (Talkin' 'bout real love)
Uh-oh, uh-oh (uh-oh)

Real love (Real love)
I'm searchin' for a real love

A synthpop song inspired by Prince, it was written by Lipa, KAMILLE, Tove Lo, Shakka and TMS, while production was handled by the latter and Stuart Price.

My A&R played me this song two years ago, and I instantly hated it. I was like, “Please never play me this again.” But a year down the line, when I was writing, he sat me down and was like, “I have something to play you.” And he just played the instrumental and I was like, “This is actually really good with no lyrics.” I went into the studio with Tove Lo and just had fun exploring. It has some Prince influences, and it was a range of my voice I hadn’t tried. This whole album was about exploring growth and trying out new things, so I wanted to embrace challenges. We wrote something that felt really real to me, and it’s just a romantic, summery song, about meeting someone who has you losing all your cool. - Dua Lipa. 

The demo before Tove & Dua Remade it was called ""Flamingos in the Pool"" Which was demoed by Kamille. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Dua+Lipa/_/Cool"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."

TYRANT Lyrics
[Intro: 
Dolly Parton
 & Beyoncé]
Cowboy Carter
Time to strike a match and light up this juke joint
One-one-one by one, you hang them high
Your hands are steady and you sleep at night
How did you turn your heart to stone?
I don't want him back, but I can't let go
Hangman, answer me now
You owe me a debt, you stole him from me
I hated you once, I envy you now
Just tell me how, tell me how
(
d.a. got that—
)
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, she got that woah there
Hangman got that woah there
Don't act like you don't know
Giddy up, giddy up
 (
d.a. got that dope
, 
hey!
)
Don't pay me in gold
Giddy up, giddy up
Back outside, I'm on the road
Giddy up, giddy up (Hey)
When the sun goes down (It's night-night)
Giddy up, giddy up (Hey)
You can  hear her body howl (In the moonlight)
Giddy up (Hey)
I feel her eyein' me like owls (It's on sight)
Giddy up, giddy up (Hey)
Hide your man when the hangman come in town (Ooh, yikes)[Chorus]
She's a tyrant every time I ride it, every time I ride it
Make it look so good, try to justify it
Boy, you know they're lookin' for me, how we gonna hide it?
Ride it like hydraulics, I am such a tyrant
Every time I ride it, every time I ride this
I don't like to sit up in the saddle, boy, I got it
Just relax, I got this, I got that exotic
Hips are so hypnotic, I am such a tyrant
[Verse]
Send me some shots, are you with me or not? Throw it back
Shoot up the bar, then tell the law we don't remember nothin' after that
Scot-free (Scot-free), whole city after me
Have you seen her? 5'9'', thique and fine, what a tragedy
Hey, hey, ridin' you while we tryna get away
Ridin' you while we tryna catch a wave
That's so sexy and I know it
, and I ain't afraid to show it
Baby, I'm goated, baby, I'm glowin'
Hey, hey, on the run, run
Tap me on the shoulder when you reload the gun
[Chorus]
Tyrant every time I ride it, every time I ride it
Make it look so good, try to justify it
Boy, you know they're lookin' for me, how we gonna hide it?
Ride it like hydraulics, I am such a tyrant[Bridge]
How did you get used to the haunting? (The haunting)
The willing, the missing, the wanting (The wanting)
Dry eyes just send me across the divide
Hangman, teach me how not to cry
How not to cry, how not to cry
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, she got that woah there
Hangman got that woah there
Don't act like you don't know (Yeah)
Giddy up, giddy up (
d.a. got that dope
, hey!)
Don't pay me in gold
Giddy up, giddy up
Back outside, I'm on the road
Giddy up, giddy up (Hey)
When the sun goes down (When the suns goes down)
Giddy up, giddy up
You can hear this body howl (You can hear this body howl)
Giddy up now, diggadont, diggadont
Digga-daddy, can't leave me 'lone, leave me 'lone
Damn if I do, dammit if I don't
Lady with a whip, want what she wanna want, okay
[Chorus]
Tyrant every time I ride it, every time I ride it
Make it look so good, cowboys justify it
Boy, you know they lookin' for me, how we gonna hide it?
Ride it like hydraulics, I am such a tyrant
Every time I ride it, every time I ride it
Baby, I just don't sit up in the saddle, boy, I got it
Just relax, I got this, I got that exotic
These hips so hypnotic, I am such a tyrant[Outro]
Hangman, answer me now
You owe me a debt, you stole him from me (Giddy up, giddy up)
I hated you once, I envy you now (Hey)
Just tell me how, tell me how

The lyrics present a story of a woman confronting a ‘hangman,’ a metaphorical figure who represents someone who has taken something precious from her. The repeated phrase “every time I ride it” suggests a sense of empowerment and control, as if the protagonist is taking charge of her own destiny despite the circumstances.

The song’s chorus, where Beyoncé declares herself a ‘tyrant,’ can be seen as a reclaiming of power. In history, a tyrant is often viewed negatively as an oppressive ruler, but here, Beyoncé flips the script, using the term to express strength and dominance, particularly in a relationship or sexual context. The lyrics “Make it look so good, tryna justify it” could imply that she is aware of the allure and influence she holds and is unapologetic about it. The song oscillates between vulnerability and assertiveness, reflecting the complexity of human emotions and relationships.

Musically, ‘TYRANT’ is infused with a blend of genres, showcasing Beyoncé’s versatility as an artist. The song’s rhythm and delivery contribute to the theme of power, with a confident and commanding tone. The use of the term ‘hangman’ and the Western imagery of ‘giddy up’ evoke a sense of the Wild West, a setting often associated with lawlessness and the struggle for control. Beyoncé’s artistry allows her to create a soundscape that complements the lyrical content, making ‘TYRANT’ a multifaceted exploration of authority and self-assertion. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Beyonc%C3%A9/_/Tyrant"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

End of Spring (English Ver.) Lyrics
[Verse 1: Yonghoon, CyA, Dongmyeong]
One charming spring night
One with shimmering moonlight
You looked so stunning bright
I could've lost my eyesight, oh, woah-oh
Every moment we have shared our memories and feelings in delight
But it is time to rewrite
Throughout the four seasons (You were the only one I saw)
Rewind the time with you in heaven (Just keep it, turn it on, on)
The time with you all passed on a sudden
And the pink blossoms were all fallen
But you stayed in the season
[Chorus: Yonghoon]
All days of laughter
All days of sad tears
All of my days with you wеre full of wonder
Most beautiful days of thе year
Faded one after another
Spring is all over
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
[Verse 2: CyA, Dongmyeong]
Nothing but this love
Has come full circle
Flowers faded one by one, everything is done
The season is about to be gone
Riding on with a gentle breeze
We're flying, 위웅위웅
Yet it's all wilted away
There is still one blooming fine[Chorus: Yonghoon]
All days of laughter
All days of sad tears
All of my days with you were full of wonder
Most beautiful days of the year
Faded one after another
Spring is all over
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
[Refrain: CyA]
Petals are falling
The season is changing
And then you are leaving
It is the end of spring
Petals are falling
The season is changing
And then you are leaving
It is the end of spring
[Bridge: Yonghoon]
Spring is all over
You're not there like before
Though I call out your name
Oh, just once more
Most beautiful days of the year
Faded one after another
Spring is all over (Oh)[Post-Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

Petals are falling
The season is changing

[Intro: Dale Warren]
Poverty's paradise
I don’t think I could find a way to make it on this earth
(I've been hungry all my life)
[Voicemail: Carl Duckworth]
What's up, family?
Yeah, it’s your cousin Carl, man, just givin' you a call, man
I know you been havin' a lot on yo' mind lately
And I know you feel like, you know
People ain't been prayin' for you
But you have to understand this, man, that we are a cursed people Deuteronomy 28:28 says, ""The Lord shall smite thee with madness And blindness, and astonishment of heart""
See, family, that's why you feel like you feel
Like you got a chip on your shoulder
Until you follow His commandments, you gonna feel that way...
[Bridge 1: Charles Edward Sydney Isom Jr. & 
Kendrick Lamar
]
Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Pain in my heart carry burdens full of struggle
Why God, why God do I gotta bleed?
Every stone thrown at you restin' at my feet
Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Earth is no more, won’t you burn this muh’fucka?
I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth
Akcuf’hum siht nrub uoy t'now ,erom on si htraE

I beat yo’ ass, keep talkin' back
I beat yo' ass, who bought you that?
You stole it, I beat yo' ass if you say that game is broken
I beat yo' ass if you jump on my couch
I beat yo' ass if you walk in this house
With tears in your eyes, runnin' from Poo Poo and Prentice
Go back outside, I beat yo' ass, lil' nigga
That homework better be finished, I beat yo' ass
Your teachers better not be bitchin' 'bout you in class
That pizza better not be wasted, you eat it all
That TV better not be loud if you got it on
Them Jordans better not get dirty when I just bought 'em
Better not hear 'bout you humpin' on Keisha's daughter
Better not hear you got caught up
I beat yo' ass, you better not run to your father
I beat yo' ass, you know my patience runnin' thin
I got buku payments to make
County building's on my ass, tryna take my food stamps away
I beat yo' ass if you tell them social workers he live here
I beat yo' ass if I beat yo' ass twice and you still here
Seven years old, think you run this house by yourself?
Nigga, you gon' fear me if you don't fear no one else
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucker up
And then I'd take two puffs
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
(Pull them panties to the side now)
I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I'll prolly die anonymous,
 
I'll prolly die with promises
I'll prolly die walkin' back home from the candy house
I'll prolly die because these colors are standin' out
I'll prolly die because I ain't know Demarcus was snitchin'
I'll prolly die at these house parties, fuckin' with bitches
I'll prolly die from witnesses leavin' me falsed accused
I'll prolly die from thinkin' that me and your hood was cool
Or maybe die from pressin' the line, actin' too extra
Or maybe die because these smokers are more than desperate
I'll prolly die from one of these bats and blue badges
Body-slammed on black and white paint, my bones snappin'
Or maybe die from panic or die from bein' too lax
Or die from waitin' on it, die 'cause I'm movin' too fast
I'll prolly die tryna buy weed at the apartments
I'll prolly die tryna defuse two homies arguin'
I'll prolly die 'cause that's what you do when you're seventeen
All worries in a hurry, I wish I controlled things
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucker up
And then I'd take two puffs
(
I've been hungry all my life
)
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
(Pull them panties to the side now)
Now[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
When I was twenty-seven, I grew accustomed to more fear
Accumulated ten times over throughout the years
My newfound life made all of me magnified
How many accolades do I need to block denial?
The shock value of my success put bolts in me
All this money, is God playin' a joke on me?
Is it for the moment, and will he see me as Job?
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?
At twenty-seven, my biggest fear was losin' it all
Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin'
Thirty shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus
What is an advisor? Somebody that's holdin' my checks
Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered
How did the Bad Girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
The type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin'
Drill somethin', get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'
I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck
At twenty-seven years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
What they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me
What they see from me would trickle down generations in time
What they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God
I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap
Damn
[Bridge 2: Bēkon]
God damn you, God damn me
God damn us, God damn we
God damn us all
[Outro: Carl Duckworth]
Verse 2 says, ""You only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities""
So until we come back to these commandments
Until you come back to these commandments
We gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse
Because He said He's gonna punish us
The so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians
Are the true children of Israel
We are the Israelites, according to the Bible
The children of Israel
He's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience
Because we chose to follow other gods
That man chastens his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee
So, just like you chasten your own son, He's gonna chasten you
Because He loves you, so that's why we get chastised
That's why we're in the position that we're in
Until we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments
And do what the Lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us
We gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live
Here, in today, in the United States of America
I love you, family, and I pray for you
God bless you
Shalom",https://genius.com/Kendrick-lamar-fear-lyrics,"",""

[Intro]
Mmm, yeah
Alright
Ooh
[Verse 1]
Got a call from an old friend, we used to be real close
Said he couldn't go on the American way
Closed his shop, sold the house, bought a ticket to the west coast
Now he gives them a stand-up routine in L.A.​
[Chorus]
I don't need you to worry for me 'cause I'm alright
I don't want you to tell me it's time to come home
I don't care what you say anymore, this is my life
Go ahead with your own life, leave me alone
[Post-Chorus]
I never said you had to offer me a second chance
(I never said you had to...)
I never said I was a victim of circumstance
(I never said...)
I still belong (Still belong)
Don't get me wrong (Get me wrong)
And you can speak your mind
But not on my time[Verse 2]
They will tell you you can't sleep alone in a strange place
Then they'll tell you you can't sleep with somebody else
Ah, but sooner or later, you sleep in your own space
Either way, it's okay, you wake up with yourself
[Chorus]
I don't need you to worry for me 'cause I'm alright
I don't want you to tell me it's time to come home
I don't care what you say anymore, this is my life

But not on my time

Go ahead with your own life, leave me alone[Outro]

On the song, Gunna delivers an effortlessly smooth chorus over signature guitar-driven production by his frequent producer, Turbo. Travis matches Gunna’s free-flowing cadence on the verse as the duo create an ode to their extravagant lives full of jewelry, private jets, and designer clothes.

The track’s title is in reference to Yosemite National Park, a scenic nature park located in California’s Sierra Nevada mountain range.

Additionally, this track is seemingly somewhat of a spiritual successor to Gunna’s April 2018 single “Sold Out Dates”. At the beginning of his verse, Travis seems to mimic the flow of Gunna’s verse on “Sold Out Dates,“ and Gunna’s chorus seems to be a homage to his cadence on that song.

Notably, the song gained attention due to NAV’s outro, which was originally mixed much quieter than Travis and Gunna’s vocals. On August 11, 2018, a better mix, with NAV’s vocals turned up, was added to streaming sites, replacing the old version. Many memes and jokes were made based around his vocal mix, with NAV acknowledging the meme in a now-deleted Instagram post.

The song’s accompanying music video, which stars Travis and Gunna, as well as Travis as a child, debuted on November 30, 2018. This video showed the adult Travis and Gunna in a plane that says ASTROWORLD, watching the child Travis exploring a jungle, looking for ASTROWORLD. NAV, however, was not featured in the video.

“YOSEMITE” debuted and peaked at No. 25 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the week of August 18, 2018.
The song was certified platinum by the RIAA on December 18, 2018. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Travis+Scott/_/YOSEMITE"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."

Whiskey and You Lyrics
Contrasts between whiskey and a woman are used to describe the lingering pain of their breakup.

The song was featured on Tim McGraw’s 2007 Let It Go album.
[Verse 1]
There's a bottle on the dresser by your ring
And it's empty so right now I don't feel a thing
And I'll be hurtin' when I wake up on the floor
But I'll be over it by noon
That's the difference between whiskey and you
[Verse 2]
Come tomorrow, I can walk in any store
It ain't a problem, they'll always sell me more
But your forgiveness
Well, that's somethin' I can't buy
There ain't a thing that I can do
That's the difference between whiskey and you
[Chorus]
One's a devil, one keeps drivin' me insane
At times I wonder if they ain't both the same
But one's a liar that helps to hide me from my pain
And one's the long gone bitter truth
That's the difference between whiskey and you
[Verse 3]
I've got a problem but it ain't like what you think
I drink because I'm lonesome and I'm lonesome 'cause I drink
But if I don't break down and bring it on myself
It'll hit out of the blue
That's the difference between whiskey and you[Chorus]
One's a devil, one keeps drivin' me insane
At times I wonder, oh, if they ain't both the same
One's a liar that helps to hide me from my pain
And one's the long gone bitter truth
That's the difference between whiskey and you
[Outro]
Aww, that's the difference between whiskey and you",https://genius.com/Chris-stapleton-whiskey-and-you-lyrics,"",""

Blue Jeans Lyrics
“Blue Jeans” is about an ex-boyfriend whom Lana compares to James Dean. The relationship started off well, but soon “the bad boy” up and left. Eventually he became caught up in chasing money and selling drugs…

[Verse 1]
Blue jeans, white shirt
Walked into the room, you know you made my eyes burn
It was like James Dean for sure
You're so fresh to death and sick as ca-cancer
You were sorta punk rock, I grew up on hip-hop
But you fit me better than my favorite sweater
And I know that love is mean (Oh-oh) and love hurts (Oh-oh)
But I still remember that day we met in December, oh, baby
[Chorus]
I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember (Oh, baby)
Say you'll remember (Oh, baby)
Ooh, I will love you 'til the end of time
[Verse 2]
Big dreams, gangsta
Said you had to leave to start your life over
I was like, ""No, please, stay here
We don't need no money, we could make it all work""
But he headed out on Sunday, said he'd come home Monday
I stayed up waiting, anticipatin' and pacing
But he was chasin' (Oh-oh) paper (Oh-oh)
Caught up in the game, that was the last I heard[Chorus]
I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember (Oh, baby)
Say you'll remember (Oh, baby)
Ooh, I will love you 'til the end of time
[Bridge]
You went out every night and, baby, that's alright
I told you that, no matter what you did, I'd be by your side
'Cause I'm a ride or die whether you fail or fly
Well, shit, at least you tried
But when you walked out that door, a piece of me died
Told you I wanted more, that's not what I had in mind
I just want it like before, we were dancin' all night
Then they took you away, stole you out of my life
You just need to remember
[Chorus]
I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before

[Chorus: Hittman]
Xxplosive, West Coast shit
My nigga-ish ways attract girls that used to turn they back
Causing me to yank they arm and pose like I would do them harm
Now I'm saying, ""Thank you"" 'cause they tell me my shit's the bomb
Xxplosive
For my niggas drinking Cognac, smoking weed, always pack
More than one firearm, chrome rims, riding on
Chronic in your system, let me know my shit's the bomb
Xxplosive
[Verse 1: Kurupt]
West Coast shit, nigga
Overdosage, imperial pistols ferocious
Fuck a bitch – don't tease, bitch, striptease, bitch
Eat a bowl of these
, bitch – gobble a dick
Hoes forgot to eat a dick and shut the fuck up
 (Fuck up, bitch)
Gobble and swallow a nut up, shut up and get my cash (Cash)
Backhanded, pimp-slapped backwards and left stranded
Just pop your collar, pimp convention, hoes for a dollar
Six-Deuce in a plush six-deuce Impala
Pimping hoes from Texas to Guatemala
Bitch niggas pay for hoes (Hoes), just to lay with hoes (Hoes)
Relax one night and pay to stay with hoes (Hoes)
Captain Save-'Em-All-Day
 (Bitch) – well, save this dick
Bitch nigga, you more of a bitch than a bitch
You ain't into hittin' pussy or hittin' a switch
You into hitting bitches off with a grip, you punk bitch[Verse 2: Nate Dogg]
All my real dogs still kick it with me
All my down hoes still trickin’ with me
All the true gangstas know
Nate ain't never love no hoe
All the hoodrats still shake it for me
All my true fans still checkin’ for me
All the real smokers know
Nate ain't passin’ nothin’ but dope
Indeed
Real trees
Chronic leaves
No seeds
When I met you last night, baby
Before
 
I blew your mind (Blew, blew, blew your mind)
I thought we had a chance, lady
No more—now that I'm sober, you ain't that fine, mm-mm
Don't wanna treat you wrong
Don't wanna lead you on
Here, baby, hit the bong
While the West Coast rolls along
(While we) Still making gangsta hits
(You'll be) Still jocking gangsta dicks
Damn, girl, you think you're slick?
Somebody better get this bitch, this bitch...[Verse 3: Six-Two]
I got these freaky hoes clapping their hands, stomping their feet
Every now and then, they put they mouth on me
Nowadays, a G like me can't even call it
A 23-year-old pussy fiend and freakaholic
Pimping bitches on the regular, I put that on the G
A hustler and a player–nowadays, it pays to be
Let me drop some shit about this bitch I used to know
She gave your boy the head and said, ""Don't let nobody know""
A bona fide pro, I had to grab the ho
She got freaky in your '64, I skeeted in her throat
Been knowin' the ho for four days, pimpery pays
And I bet you didn't know that she go both ways
She ate her best friend, I left them hoes at the mo'
They be beeping me and shit, but we don't kick it no more
Them hot hoes is fiending, they on the nuts
But bitch, I'm out your pussy when I nut, for real

End Of An Era Lyrics
[Intro]
One, two, three, ayy
[Verse 1]
What's it about a kiss that makes me feel like this?
Makes me an optimist, I guess
I always jump too quick, hopin' this one might stick
Hopelessly romantic
[Pre-Chorus]
Then you said, ""Hey,"" and I said, ""Hey
What's your name?""
Come with me
'Cause when I see your face (Ah)
[Chorus]
The sweetest pleasure
I feel like we're gonna be together
This could be the end of an era
Who knows, baby? This could be forever, forever
[Verse 2]
No more ""you're not my type"", no more ""at lеast I tried""
Done with the lonеly nights, I guess
One chapter might be done, God knows I had some fun
New one has just begun[Pre-Chorus]
You said, ""Hey,"" and I said, ""Hey
What's your name?""
Come with me
'Cause when I see your face (Ah)
[Chorus]
The sweetest pleasure
I feel like we're gonna be together
This could be the end of an era
Who knows, baby? This could be forever, forever
[Post-Chorus]
In the clouds, there she goes
Butterflies, let them flow
'Nother girl falls in love
Another girl leaves the club
Send a big kiss goodbye
To all of the pretty eyes (End of an era)
Another girl falls in love
Another girl leaves the club (Forever)
[Bridge]
I've lost all my senses
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
Is this my happy ending?
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
(Here she goes again)[Chorus]
The sweetest pleasure
I feel like we're gonna be together
This could be the end of an era
Who knows, baby? This could be forever and ever

“We went through quite a few verses and we changed a bit of that. When we started writing “End of an Era”, we started on the production and then we started writing melodies. And I was like “This isn’t right” so I actually called off that session. I was like we’re going to leave Kevin and Danny to just work on the track for the day and we’re going to leave because I feel like we’re getting block and we’re hitting a wall. We’re not getting the right melodies. It just didn’t feel right so we left. We came back the next day and we heard the the track with fresh ears.

Grapejuice Lyrics
[Intro]
One, two, three
One, two—
[Verse 1]
Yesterday, it finally came, a sunny afternoon
I was on my way to buy some flowers for you
Thought that we could hide away in a corner of the heath
There's never been someone who's so perfect for me
[Pre-Chorus]
But I got over it and I said
""Give me something old and red""
I pay for it more than I did back then
[Chorus]
There's just no getting through
Without you
A bottle of rouge
Just me and you
[Verse 2]
Sittin' in the garden, I'm a couple glasses in
I was tryna count up all the places we'vе been
You're always there, so don't ovеrthink
I'm so over whites and pinks[Pre-Chorus]
I pay for it more than I did back then
[Chorus]
There's just no getting through
Without you
A bottle of rouge

These shits get cold, I stay with a pole, to make it back home
I don't even worry 'bout no one, stay on my dolie, on my 'lone

Whole lotta motion the fuck is the vibe, and you know this shit ain't never slowin'

[Verse 1]
I envy the leaves
That grow from the trees
They're all so carefree
Through the seasons, unaware of the fall
If only I'd see (See)
It's quite easy to be (Be)
A drop in the ocean with no worries and no questions at all
[Chorus]
Why don't we lie and
Act like the best is yet to come?
Why don't we try that
Just for once?
[Verse 2]
I envy the snow (Snow)
How it's blissfully cold (Cold)
The world around, it is meltin' and it still doesn't know
It could be so sweet (Sweet, sweet)
If only I were naive (Naive)
Enough to believe that I am happy, but, still, I'm not sold
[Chorus]
Why don't wе lie and
Act like the bеst is yet to come?
Why don't we try that
Just for once?[Bridge]
For once
For once
Why don't we try that
Just for once?
Ooh
Ooh
Just for once?

Eh, eh, eh, eh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Eh, eh, eh, eh
Oh no
[Verse 1]
You can get real close, talkin', you talkin' now
Underneath our clothes, pretend that we know it all
Shut off the lights just to hide in the dark
(Hide in the) Dark, (Hide in the) dark
Think that I know you the farther you are
(Farther you are, farther you are) No
[Pre-Chorus]
Like A-B-C-D, that could work so perfectly
If perfect was the kind of thing that worked for me
But I wanna feel nervous, just a little bit off the edge
(Wanna feel, wanna feel, wanna feel)
Even if I know that I will end up in a mess
[Chorus]
Like eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, it won't be perfect
But I know, oh, oh, oh, oh, it could be worth it
And for all of the nights I left tears running down my face, messing up my mascara
It's not perfect, eh, eh, eh, but maybe that's what we need
(That's what we need)[Verse 2]
See right through the fiction and all of this fakery
(All of this fakery)
Just give me some friction, let me see what nobody sees
(See what nobody sees)
You don't think that I can handle the truth
(Handle the truth, handle the truth)
Baby, I'm over just playing it cool, no
[Pre-Chorus]
Like A-B-C-D, that could work so perfectly
If perfect was the kind of thing that worked for me
But I wanna feel nervous, just a little bit off the edge
(Wanna feel, wanna feel, wanna feel)
Even if I know that I will end up in a mess

Like eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, it won't be perfect
(And you know that I'm with you, baby)
But I know, oh, oh, oh, oh, it could be worth it
(And I know it could be worth it, baby)
And for all of the nights I left tears running down my face, messing up my mascara
It's not perfect, eh, eh, eh, but maybe that's what we need

That's what we need (That's what we need)
That's what we need (That's what we need)
Baby, do you think that you could give it to me?
That's what we need
That's what we need
Baby, do you think that you could give it to me?[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
You keep me in your orbit
Well, I know I'm a hard one to please
Give it too much importance
My love will have you fall to your knees
I tell 'em this too often
Know better than to bark up my tree
Just for me to fall and leave
Nah, I'd rather just watch you smoke and drink, yeah

Steering clear of any headaches to start
And if we're being honest
I'd rather your body than half of your heart

Hate gettin' too emotional (Woah), yeah

I'm better off being a wild one
On the road a lot, had to keep it a thousand
So that I'm better off not being around ya
[Verse 2]
Go on and face it, I'll never be ready for you, ready for you
I swear my love is a curse, make you head over shoes, head over shoes
Let's put them topics to bed and go fuck on the roof, just to say that we did it
You keep insisting I listen to your proposition, I dismiss 'em all, no offense, yeah[Pre-Chorus]
Steering clear of any headaches to start
And if we're being honest
I'd rather your body than half of your heart
Or jealous-ridden comments
That come when you let in them feelings that I don't want
I never let 'em know too much
Hate gettin' too emotional, yeah

I'm better off being a wild one
On the road a lot, had to keep it a thousand

The song finds Ariana realizing that a relationship isn’t for her and that she’s “better off without him” as she’d “rather [his] body than half of [his] heart”. Hence, to “steer clear of any headaches to start”, she “dismisses” his propositions.

It has been speculated the track is about Ariana’s former boyfriend, Mac Miller, a relationship with whom she’s previously denounced as “toxic” and the editor’s notes for the album on Apple Music express similar sentiments saying “ she exits a toxic relationship in “better off”. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Ariana+Grande/_/Better+Off"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Chasing down the hourglass
Running from my past
Headed out with no direction (

Looking for her matchstick king to burn in to my heart
Hand in to the flame
We could set the world ablaze 'cause

Breathless, I can’t resist
Melt with your scarlet kiss
Like a wildfire, like a wildfire

I look into your sunset eyes
Waiting for the moon to rise
So, I can feel your heat
This love is so completely crazy

You can burn this city with me
Play me like your first guitar
Where every single note's too hard

You can take me there
We can set the world on fire

Regulus (English Ver.) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
The name of the star that I live on
Often, they call it the regulus
Even though it may be dark all day
I'm not lonely at all
In this place where I live and breathe
There's a flower that resembles you
It doesn't wither or fade away
It always stays by my side
[Pre-Chorus]
This night, this moon and stunning day
You can't be described
Let's hold our hands together
And go live on ecstatic isle
So that it doesn't escape away, the tip of our fingers ends
The blue ocean, the sand weighing the size of our love again
My heart's made of you, extend
Tock-tock, after the rain goes, we have bloomed in full
[Chorus]
The name of the star that I live on
Often, they call it the regulus
Even though it may be dark all day
I'm not lonely at all
In this place where I live and breathe
There's a flower that resembles you
It doesn't wither or fade away
It always stays by my side, oh[Verse 2]
The moment the sound of your footsteps come across galaxy
The burning sunshine and moonlight are already waiting for you to come
[Pre-Chorus]
This night, this moon and stunning day
You can't be described
Shall we take two petals off
And cherish them one by one?
Even if I can't remember 'cause I have faded away
So that you're the only one who knows
Under the horizon star, I will bury the secret
Tock-tock, so the flower of you can bloom again
[Chorus]
The name of the star that I live on
Often, they call it the regulus
Even though it may be dark all day
I'm not lonely at all
In this place where I live and breathe
There's a flower that resembles you
It doesn't wither or fade away
It always stays by my side
[Post-Chorus]
I'm withering, but you don't be withering
Remember me even when I'm gone, yeah, just a little selfishly
This star is precious a living and breathing memory
Even if it's far away from the earth, mm[Bridge]
I'm hoping, can you stay the way you are?
Underneath the lights of the star shooting shining night
After the moon sets, until the dawn sky reveals you
[Chorus]
Endless stars on the night sky gleam
They will shine facing towards the earth
The place I breathe called regulus
It'll shine on you
Out of the many that I've met
You're the only one I'll remember
You who is listening to this song now
I'll remember you, oh",https://genius.com/Onewe-regulus-english-ver-lyrics,"Lyrics by: Kanghyun, Giuk, Heungeul;

When you refuse me, you confuse me
What makes you think I'll let you in again?
Think again, my friend
Go on, misuse me and abuse me
I'll come out stronger in the end

Does it make you sad
To find yourself alone?
Does it make you mad

You won't find me 'cause I'm not coming home

Does it make you mad

Beautiful Goodbye Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I count the ways I let you down
On my fingers and toes, but I'm running out
Clever words can't help me now
I grip you tight, but you're slipping out
[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I remember your eyes were so bright
When I first met you, so in love that night
And now I'm kissing your tears goodnight
And I can't take it, you're even perfect when you cry

Beautiful goodbye (Bye-bye, bye-bye)
It's dripping from your eyes (Bye-bye, bye-bye)

When did the clouds begin to form?
Yeah, we got knocked off course by a natural force
And we'll, we'll be swimming when it's gone

And I remember your eyes were so bright
When I first met you, so in love that night
And now I'm kissing your tears goodnight

It's dripping from your eyes (Bye-bye, bye-bye)

All the pain you try to hide
Shows through your mascara lines
As they stream down from your eyes
And let them go, let them fly
Holding back won't turn back time
Believe me, I've tried

And your eyes were so bright
I remember your eyes were so bright
And I remember your eyes were so bright
When I first met you, how in love were we that night?
And now I'm kissing your tears goodnight
And I can't take it, you're even perfect when you cry

The version featured on the single and album was recorded in ten takes on 11 September 1962 at Abbey Road Studios, London. Session drummer Andy White gave the recording a lightweight cha cha treatment,  and consequently it misses the distinctive heavy drum beat that characterised most of their early music. Ringo Starr plays maracas.

Martin was not physically present at the session, which was run by Ron Richards in his absence. Richards told the group that the song could not be the A-side of their single because of an earlier song of the same title, so it was relegated to the B-side (even though other titles had and have been used for multiple hit songs without legal difficulties).

The Beatles (with Starr playing drums) also recorded this song at the BBC on 25 October 1962, 27 November 1962, and 17 June 1963 for subsequent broadcast on the BBC radio programs Here We Go, Talent Spot, and Pop Go The Beatles, respectively. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/P.S.+I+Love+You"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The fact you're not impressed
Are you playing hard to get?
Or maybe you're not interested

Why everybody thinks you're sweet
'Cause I see the opposite
No, you're not so innocent[Pre-Chorus]

[Intro: Kanye West]
Boom, b-boom, b-boom-boom
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Drive slow, homie
Drive slow, homie
You never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My homie Mali used to stay, 79th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street from Calumet,
 
a school full of Stones
He nicknamed me ""K-Rock"" so they'd leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand
Keys in his hand, reason again to let you know he's the man
Back when we rocked Ellesses
, 
he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers, even more by polices
How he get the cash? The day his father passed away
Left him with a lil' something, sixteen, he was stuntin'
Al B. Sure! nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit Lake Shore, girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway, go at least 'bout eighty
Boned so much that summer, even had him a baby
See back— back then— then, if you had a car
You was the Chi-Town version of Baby
And I was just a virgin, 
a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
We'd take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had them Lincolns and auroras, we was hurtin' 'em all
With the girls, a lot of flirting involved, but, dawg
Fuck all that flirting, I'm tryna get in some drawers
So put me on with these hoes, homie
He told me, ""Don't rush to get grown, drive slow, homie""[Chorus: Kanye West]
Drive slow, homie
(Drive slow)
You never know, homie, about these hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie
[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
What it do? I'm posted up in the parking lot, my trunk wavin'
The candy gloss is immaculate, it's simply amazin'
Them elbows poking wide on that candy 'Lac
Trunk open, screens on, 
neons lit with fifth
, relaxed
I'm on a mission for dime-pieces and sexy ladies
Allow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes
It's a star-studded event when I valet park
Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
You see them fours crawlin'? You see them screens fallin'?
The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin'
I'm leanin' on the switch, sittin' crooked in my slab
But I could still catch boppers if I drove a cab
A young Houston hard-hitter, all about the scrilla
Ridin' somethin' candy-coated, crawlin' like a caterpillar
I'm tippin' on them fours,
 
I'm jammin' on this Screw
I'm lookin' for them hoes, baby, what it do? Drive slow, homie
[Chorus: Kanye West & 
GLC
]
Turn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes
Drive slow, homie
If you're ridin' around the city with nowhere to go
Drive slow, homie
Live today, 'cause tomorrow, man, you never know
You never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie[Verse 3: GLC & 
Kanye West
]
My car's like the movie, my car's like the crib
I got more TVs in here than where I live
And that don't make no sense, but baby, I'm the shit
And everything I flip, you know it's somethin' serious
I got the custom grill, I got the Brabus rims
I got the baller genetics, baby, this evidence
You see a player flickin', and how you ain't convinced
That you should go on and kiss it, just a lil' bit (Just a lil' bit)
I wear my custom kicks, I got my Jesus chain
My canaries is gleamin' through my angel wings
They see me, hoes actin' like they seen a king
With that mean lean,
 
smokin' on that finest Cali Green
My woodgrain oak, I'm ridin' on Vogues
My cylinder quiet, like tiptoes
I sold O's, and this, I know
When you see them hoes, lil' homie, drive slow (Drive slow)

I Wonder Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I wonder why
All of the clouds cleared from the sky
I wonder why
All of the tears dried from my eyes
I woke up happy, watched the sunrise, rise

I wonder why, I wonder why
(I wonder why, I wonder why)

And now each breath of air is sweeter
Birds are singin', grass is greener
Suddenly, the world is bright again (The world is bright again)
I used to live to die by
Somebody else's side, but
Now a new day breaks and I feel fine (I feel just fine)
I wonder why
[Verse 2]
I wonder how
I felt so cold, it's summеr now
I wonder how
I ever lеarned to live in doubt
It's time the walls came tumblin' down, down[Pre-Chorus]
I wonder how, I wonder how
(I wonder how, I wonder how)
[Chorus]
And now each breath of air is sweeter
Birds are singin', grass is greener
Suddenly, the world is bright again (The world is bright again)
I used to live to die by
Somebody else's side, but
Now a new day breaks and I feel fine (I feel just fine)
I wonder why

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
You ain't gotta answer none of my calls
I'm believing you'll pick up one day
I don't wanna add to your pain at all
I'm praying that time makes a change in your life
I'm realizing how much you made a change in my life
And I don't wanna spend it with nobody else
Hear me? Don't nobody deserve myself
Oh no, baby what I'm saying is
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Right now, don't rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Calm down, don't rush, no pressure
[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Thought that you were in it for the paper
Never thought I'd take you serious
Now I need you, not a moment later
Losin' it, I'm so delirious
And I'ma put up a fight for it
Never give up a love like this
Finally I found someone
That can do me like no other
Talking to my conscience
I made a few mistakes
I did it to myself
I'm the only one to blame
I know you need a little while to believe again
To love again[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Right now, don't rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
I'll be waiting for you
Don't rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Right now, don't rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Don't rush, no pressure
[Bridge: Justin Bieber]
Put my key in the ignition
Don't rush it girl, just stretch it out for me
I know that you ain’t got no place to be
Girl I need your attention
And every time I see you make that face
I wanna love you all over the place
Don't do it, baby
Don't do it to me, no, no
[Verse 3: Big Sean]
I know you don't wanna talk, right
We've been on and off like the cross lights
You heard I'm playin' with them hoes like I golf, right?
When I touch you, I get frostbite
Girl you're so cold, so cold, so cold
How we so young but livin' so old?
In the bed together but we sleepin' solo
That could drive you loco
You supposed to be my uno, Yoko Ono
Oh no, round two again
We've been fighting more than Ryu and Ken
Last time we argued eight straight days
I learned my lesson, I got straight As
And I know it's deeper than masseuses
Oh, you know I eat the cookie like I'm Lucious
Go ahead and take the time
But it's a waste of time if your waist ain't on mine
Think about it[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
You ain't gotta make your mind up
(make your mind up)
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
(right now)
Don't rush, no pressure

You ain't gotta make your mind up

You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now

He realized how important this girl is for him and now he is willing to make up to her for all the pain that he put her through in their past relationship.

Under the pressure of the public eye, Justin has admittedly made mistakes. He moved in with his then girlfriend, Selena Gomez, after only dating for three months. The two later went through a break-up. In 2014, he was arrested for a DUI while drag racing his Ferrari.

“No Pressure” marks the third official collaboration between Justin and rapper Big Sean; their first two being “As Long As You Love Me” and “Memphis,” both songs from his previous albums.

The official video was released November 14, 2015 and features black and white choreographed dancing.

[Intro]
This should be played at high volume
Preferably in a residential area
[Verse 1: The Lady of Rage]
Now I'ma kick up dust as I begin to bust
On the wick-wack, fucked up suckers you can't trust
When I kick up, I lick up, your face get smacked up
When I rack up, so all you motherfuckers just pack up
Or get slapped with the swiftness
If you think you're swift with the gift, Merry Christmas
Now stuff that in your stockin'
I'm knockin' 'em out the box and
Knockin' 'em out their socks and 'cause 
Robin is rockin'
Breakin' 'em down to the slab
Takin' 'em down on their ass
Now what you wanna do? You wanna battle? Uh
Send you up shit creek without a motherfuckin' paddle
Rattle that brain, I'm not the same old plain Jane
Roll on you like a boulder, you're nothin' more than a grain
Or a pebble, 
take it from the real rap rebel
Not Bushwick Bill but I can take it to that other level
You think you got pull? Then pull it, uh
I got the trigger, so I figure you'll bite the bullet
Then bite the dust and wipe the fuss
Do what I must, and what I must is bust
A bubble or two, some trouble for you
So skip to my Luger, Lady of Rage is comin' through[Interlude: B-Real]
Some cool shit
Some cool shit
Boo-ya, spittin' out buckshots
[Verse 2: Kurupt]
I fears no one, I makes 'em cool off like the polar cap
Clenchin' as the hits misses the roller's back
Pushin' packs to make a profit
Diggy dope duck on the topic, so stop and give me my props, kid
I'm livin' large like a fat bitch
So get back, bitch, I'm hard to bogart so the fact is
This young black kid a mercenary, merciless
Murderin' millions of niggas, so who's first to diss?
They say I'm bad, so you'll find none worse than this
Chewin' motherfuckers up like a Hershey's Kiss
Put to sleep, lovin' the lyrics I leave in the minds of each
Rough when flex, too complex, wrecks your mental piece
So feel the wrath, nigga, I rip in half, niggas
You're quick to talk shit, I whoop your ass, nigga
Then watch me blast, nigga, 'cause I'm the last nigga
You wanna fuck with, so up your cash, nigga
I make 'em stagger, I'm scandalous as Jimmy Swaggart
I'm a good tracker, scopin' your girl then watch me tag her
Pullin' steel like a stunt
Shown like an ID card, nigga, no needs to front, so
Here to torment, I put track on crack
And I'm strapped with a semi-tone milli-ten MAC
Yo, I breaks 'em off, I breaks 'em off, chief
Deadly as Jason on 
Friday the 13th[Interlude: B-Real]
A to the motherfuckin' K
[Verse 3: RBX]
Back in the days, niggas, they used to scrap
But now in '92, niggas, they pull their strap
'Cause, um, police, them come wicked then them shoot niggas
So niggas retaliate and start to loot
Execute
, boot stompin'
Black soldier here to teach and mold ya
The innovator, dominator, narrator
R-B to the motherfuckin' X, flex wicked
Stylee, bump and be found and do bleed by a
Maniac with a gat
See, nowadays, niggas is like that
I pull my trigger back, the bullets go
Buh-buh-buh, now I'm on death row
Fuck it, niggas goin' wild
Every night they shoot, it's like Beirut
Maybe you should get a Kevlar vest for your chest
Anytime steppin' through my hood
But that'll do you no good
One slug to your face, don't hate
You're gettin' smoked like wood
Nasty nigga, bloody pumps, face flat
On the concrete, 
here comes the white sheet
Mr. Coroner, caught with some yellow tape
But the murderers escape
Audi like five G's

Go

Why is it so hard to accept the party is over?
You came with your new friends
And her mom jeans and her new Vans
And she's perfect and I hate it
Oh, so glad you made it, I'm so glad you could come by
Somebody get the tacos, somebody spark the blunt
Let's start the 
Narcos
 off at episode one
Bring the gin, got the juice, bring the sin, got that too
Won't you shut up? Know you're my favorite
Am I

I'm sorry I'm not more ladylike
I'm sorry I don't shave my legs at night

I'm sorry you got karma comin' to you
Collect your soul, get it right[Chorus]

Sorry, I just need to see you, I'm
Sorry I'm so clingy, I don't mean to be a lot
Do you really wanna love me down like you say you do?
Give it to me like you say you do?
'Cause it's hard enough you got to treat me like this
Lonely enough to let you treat me like this
Do you really love me
Or just wanna love me down, down, down, down?

Warm enough for you outside, baby, yeah

Warm enough for you inside me, me, me, me (Me, me, me, me, me)

Mmm-mm, mm-mm
Mmm-mm, mm-mm
Mmm-mm, mm-mm, yeah
[Verse 1]
Hey, Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked, we were talking
I didn't say half the things I wanted to
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
Hey, Stephen, boy, you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone
[Chorus]
'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself
[Verse 2]
Hey, Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling
So I got some things to say to you, ha
I've seen it all, so I thought
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
Hey, Stephen, why are people always leaving?
I think you and I should stay the same[Chorus]
'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself
[Bridge]
They're dimming the street lights, you're perfect for me
Why aren't you here tonight?
I'm waiting alone now, so come on and come out
And pull me near and shine, shine, shine
[Breakdown]
Hey, Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls, well, they're beautiful
But would they write a song for you? (Ha-ha)
[Chorus]
I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself
If you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so

Keep a bigger smile on my face being alone

God Gave Me Style Lyrics
“God Gave Me Style” is the 19th track off of 50 cent’s sophomore album, “The Massacre.”

The song is about how much 50 feels blessed by the Lord, even with all the struggles he had to go through.
[Chorus]
God gave me style, God gave me grace
God give me style, God give me grace
God put a smile on my face
Ha-ha, God put this smile on my face
God make me shine like the sun
God make me shine like the sun
Sometimes I feel like I'm the one
Sometimes I feel like I'm the one
[Bridge]
It ain't my fault, I just reach for style
I'm hot, I breaks it down
It ain't my fault, you can't break it down
The way I break it down
[Verse 1]
Listen, you can call me what you want, black and ugly
But you can't convince me the Lord don't love me
When my CD's drop, they sell the best
You call it luck, why can't it just be I'm blessed
I'm a track star runnin' through life chasin' my dreams
Best deal I made was tradin' the mic for that triple beam
I zone off thinkin' is there really heaven or hell
If so what happens to a changed man that dies in a cell?
I need no answers to these questions, 'cause time will tell
Got a date with destiny, she's more than a girl
Don't much good come from me, but my music
It's a gift given from God, so I'ma use it - yeah[Chorus]
God gave me style, God gave me grace
God give me style, God give me grace
God put a smile on my face
Ha-ha, God put this smile on my face
God make me shine like the sun
God make me shine like the sun
Sometimes I feel like I'm the one
Sometimes I feel like I'm the one
[Bridge]
It ain't my fault, I just reach for style
I'm hot, I breaks it down
It ain't my fault, you can't break it down
The way I break it down
[Verse 2]
Some days I'm in the crowd, all by myself
Bunch of niggas around, I'm still by myself
I drift off on a cloud, by myself
Thinkin 'bout nothin more, than life - what else?
These days it's hard to tell who really cares for me
So when you hear this song, you should say a prayer for me
I put a message in my music, hope it brightens your day
If times are hard when you hear it, know you'll be okay
A O.G. told me God's favorites have a hard time
You're out the hood, that's good, now stay on the grind
I'm a sponge, knowledge, and wisdom I ab-sorb fast
I'm in a class by myself, you do the math[Chorus]
God gave me style, God gave me grace
God give me style, God give me grace
God put a smile on my face
Ha-ha, God put this smile on my face
God make me shine like the sun
God make me shine like the sun
Sometimes I feel like I'm the one
Sometimes I feel like I'm the one

If you ain't got two kids by twenty-one
You're probably gonna die alone
At least that's what tradition told you
And it don't matter if you don't believe
Come Sunday morning you best be
There in the front row, like you're s'posed to

Same hurt in every heart
Same trailer, different park

Mama's hooked on Mary Kay
Brother's hooked on Mary Jane
And Daddy's hooked on Mary two doors down
Mary, Mary, quite contrary
We get bored so we get married
And just like dust, we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round
And 'round and 'round we go
Where it stops, nobody knows
And it ain't slowin' down
This merry go 'round
[Verse 2]
We think the first time's good enough
So we hold on to high school love
Say we won't end up like our parents
Tiny little boxes in a row
Ain't what you want, it's what you know
Just happy in the shoes you're wearin'[Pre-Chorus 2]
Same checks we're always cashin'
To buy a little more distraction
[Chorus]
'Cause Mama's hooked on Mary Kay
Brother's hooked on Mary Jane
And Daddy's hooked on Mary two doors down
Mary, Mary, quite contrary
We get bored so we get married
And just like dust, we settle in this town

And 'round and 'round we go
Where it stops, nobody knows
And it ain't slowin' down
This merry go 'round

We're so bored until we're buried

""Merry Go 'Round"" won the Grammy Award for Best Country Song at the 56th Grammy Awards.

The song is a cynical observation on life in the American heartland. It uses samples of the nursery rhyme ""Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary"" as a continued play-on-words. The latter part of the song retells another traditional nursery rhyme, ""Jack and Jill"", in a modernized fashion. It is in the key of F-sharp major, in a 2/2 time signature with an approximate tempo of 88 beats per minute. The song's main accompaniment is guitar and banjo.

Giving it 4.5 stars out of 5, Billy Dukes of Taste of Country compared the song's style and Musgraves' voice favorably to Miranda Lambert. It received a ""thumbs up"" from Juli Thanki of Engine 145, who said that Musgraves ""writes with a maturity beyond her 24 years, delivering an unflinching look into small-town life that’s more nuanced than the highly romanticized rural anthems offered up by many of her male counterparts.""

It also made ""NPR Music's 100 Favorite Songs of 2012"" list. It was number 1 on Billboard's ""10 Best Country Singles of 2013"" list.

Rolling Stone named it the 49th best single of 2012. It was also ranked number 362 in the 2021 revision of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Kacey+Musgraves/_/Merry+Go+%27Round"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

[Verse 1]
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all
[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Woah)
Forgetting him was like tryin' to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red (Red, red)
(Red, red)
But loving him was red (Red, red)
(Red, red)
[Verse 2]
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong
[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Woah)
Forgetting him was like tryin' to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red (Red, red)
Oh, red (Red, red)
Burning red (Red, red)
(Red, red)[Bridge]
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible when I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Burning, it was red
[Chorus]
Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Woah)
Forgetting him was like tryin' to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red (Red, red)
Yeah, yeah, red (Red, red)
Oh, burning red (Red, red)
(Red, red)
[Post-Chorus]
And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head (Red, red)
Comes back to me, burning red (Red, red)

Yeah, yeah (Red, red)

Something in the way you move
I like it when you dance for me (I just think it's—)
You all the time (Time, time)
In doses at night (Night, night)
No roof on the drive
Dust off the high
And go to sleep (Go to sleep, go to sleep)[Chorus]
I just think you're cool
I dig your cinema
Do you think I'm cool, too?

That was a theme across the whole album, actually: We used to book a studio and be like, ‘Okay, we’ve got it for two months, grind it out.’ But some days you just don’t want to be there, and eventually you’ve been in the studio so long, the only thing you can write about is nothing because you haven’t done anything.

[Produced by Kanye West]
[Intro: Otis Redding and 
Kanye West
]
Wished I had told ooh was 
(the)
 only one 
(uh oh)
But it's too late
It's too late
He's gone
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
You sweat her, and I ain't talkin 'bout a Coogi
You a big L, and I ain't talkin 'bout Cool J
See me at the airport, at least twenty Louis
Treat me like the Prince and this my sweet brother Numpsay
(Brother Numpsay!) Groupies say I'm too choosy
Take 'em to the show and talk all through the movies
Say she want diamonds, I took her to Ruby Tuesdays
If we up in Fridays, I still have it my way, gone!
[Hook 1: Kanye West and 
Cam'ron
]
Gone
We striving home
Gone
I ride on chrome
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Y'all don't want no prob' from me
What you rappers could get is a job from me
Maybe you could be my intern, and in turn
I'll show you how I cook up summer in the winter
Aaron love the raw dog, when will he learn
Caught something on the Usher tour, he had to let it burn
Plus, he already got three chil'r'n
Arguin' over babysitters like, ""Bitch, it's your turn""
""Damn, Ye, it'd be stupid to diss you
Even your superficial raps is super-official""
R-R-R-Roc Pastelle with Gucci on
With TVs in the ride, throw a movie on
Said he couldn't rap, now he at the top where dude belong
'Cause I dookied on any song that they threw me on, gone[Hook 2: Cam'ron and Otis Redding]
We striving home, gone
I ride on chrome, gone
We striving home
We striving home, gone (Killa)
I ride on chrome
[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
Knock knock, who's there? Killa Cam, Killa who?
Killa Cam, hustler, grinder, guerilla troop
Oh, my chinchilla blue, blue,
 
you ever dealt with a dealer
Well, here's the deal, ma, we going to the dealer, woo
No concealing, no ceiling I don't need a roof
Act up, get out, I don't need you, poof!
Poof, be gone, damn, tough luck, dag (Dag)
Niggas still doing puff-puff-pass (Puff, pass)
Pull the truck up fast and I tell 'em
Hey, back in a touched-up Jag, shit
Y'all niggas wanna get in Cam's cerebellum
An old man just gon' tell 'em too late
Then I see how y'all gonna react when I'm gone
My last girl want me back then I'm on
Fine, stay, you got the grind, hey
Came back, read what the sign say (
Too late, he's gone
)
Yes, I know you wanna see my demise
Yeah, you church, boy, acting like a thief in disguise
Ain't even my size, see the greed in my eyes
Ask Abby, I hustle, brought weed to the Chi, chyeah
And that ain't even a lie, please believe me
Gave Weezie a piece of the pie and
You can ask George or Regina
The whole West Side I explore with the
 Bimmer now[Hook 3: Cam'ron]
We striving home
I ride on chrome
Listen, homeboy, move on
That's your best bet, why's that, Cons'?
[Verse 4: Consequence]
I been pouring out some liquor for the fact that my pal's gone
And trying to help his mama with the fact that her child gone
And since we used to bubble like a tub full of Calgon
Guess it's only right that I should help her from now on
But since they got afoul on what could've gone wrong
Now they asking ""Cons, how long has this gone on?""
And maybe all this money might have gone to my head
'Cause they got me thinking money might have gone to the Feds
So I had gone to the dread, but he had gone up to bed
And when I came the next morning, he was gone with my bread
And with that being said, I had gone on my instincts
And goin' to the spots where they go to get mixed drinks
But looking back now, I should've gone to the crib
And rented 
Gone With the Wind
, 'cause I'da gone in by ten
But I had gone with my friend, and we had gone to the bar
And heard a nigga talking shit so I had gone to the car
And now the judge is telling me that I had gone too far
And now we gone for twenty years doing time behind bars
And since I gone to a cell for some petty crimes
I guess I gone to the well one too many times, 'cause I'm gone[Break: Kanye West]
Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh uh uh onnn, uh uh-uh onnn
Uh-uh onnn, uh uh-uh
[Verse 5: Kanye West]
I'm ahead of my time, sometimes years out
So the powers that be won't let me get my ideas out
And that make me wanna get my advance out
And move to Oklahoma and just live at my aunt's house
Yeah, I romance the thought of leaving it all behind
Kanye step away from the lime
Light like when I was on the grind
In the 1-9-9-9
Before model chicks was bending over
Or dealerships asked me ""Benz or Rover?""
Man, if I could just get one beat on Hova
We could get up off this cheap-ass sofa
What the summer of the Chi got to offer an eighteen-year-old?
Sell drugs or get a job, you gotta play your role
My dog worked at Taco Bell, hooked us up plural
Fired a week later, the manager count the churros
Sometimes I can't believe it when I look up in the mirro'
How we out in Europe, spending Euros
They claim you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I know I got it, I don't know what y'all on
I'ma open up a store for aspiring MCs
Won't sell 'em no dream, but the inspiration is free
But if they ever flip sides like Anakin
You'll sell everything including the mannequin
They got a new bitch, now you Jennifer Aniston
Hold on, I'll handle it, don't start panickin', stay calm
Shorties at the door 'cause they need more
Inspiration for they life, they souls, and they songs
They said, ""Sorry, Mr. West is gone""",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-gone-lyrics,"In the closing track off 2005’s ""Late Registration"", Cam'ron, Consequence, and Kanye West himself deliver some of their best verses ever over a classic sample of Otis Redding’s “It’s Too Late,” accompanied by an orchestra arranged by co-producer Jon Brion.

[Verse 1]
The day I first met you
You told me you'd never fall in love
But now that I get you
I know fear is what it really was
[Pre-Chorus]
Now here we are, so close
Yet so far, haven't I passed the test?
When will you realize
Baby, I'm not like the rest?
[Chorus]
Don't wanna break your heart, wanna give your heart a break
I know you're scared it's wrong, like you might make a mistake
There's just one life to live and there's no time to wait, to waste
So let me give your heart a break
[Post-Chorus]
Give your heart a break, let me give your heart a break
Your heart a break, oh yeah, yeah
[Verse 2]
On Sunday, you went home
Alone, there were tears in your eyes
I called your cell phone
My love, but you did not reply[Pre-Chorus]
The world is ours if we want it
We can take it, if you just take my hand
There's no turning back now
Baby, try to understand
[Chorus]
Don't wanna break your heart, wanna give your heart a break
I know you're scared it's wrong, like you might make a mistake
There's just one life to live and there's no time to wait, to waste
So let me give your heart a break
[Post-Chorus]
Give your heart a break, let me give your heart a break
Your heart a break, there's just so much you can take
Give your heart a break, let me give your heart a break
Your heart a break, oh yeah, yeah
[Bridge]
When your lips are on my lips
Then our hearts beat as one
But you slip out of my fingertips
Every time you run
Woah, woah
[Chorus]
Don't wanna break your heart, wanna give your heart a break (Don't wanna break your heart)
I know you're scared it's wrong, like you might make a mistake (I know you're scared it's wrong)
There's just one life to live and there's no time to wait, to waste
So let me give your heart a break (Let me give your heart)
'Cause you've been hurt before, I can see it in your eyes
You try to smile it away, some things, you can't disguise
Don't wanna break your heart, baby, I can ease the ache, the ache
So let me give your heart a break[Post-Chorus]
Give your heart a break, let me give your heart a break
Your heart a break, there's just so much you can take
Give your heart a break, let me give your heart a break (Your heart)
Your heart a break (A break), oh yeah, yeah

Demi opened up a bit more about the track in a video that she posted on Twitter. ""19-years-old ... sometimes it feels like during that brief time that I've been alive that I've lived through more emotions than people twice my age,"" she said. ""I think that's the reason I sing about love so often in the music I make.""

The singer explained that despite the play on the word ""heartbreak"" in the title, the song is about the exact opposite. ""Last year I began working on a song about a different kind of love,"" said Demi. ""It's a song about showing someone you love that you're the one right in front of them. This is a song about faith.""

The song's music video finds Demi hitting difficulties in a relationship. Speaking to MTV News she explained. ""The new music video, I'm basically trying to convince a guy that I didn't break his heart, and we get into a fight and I try to win him over again. So I do something special for him at the end of the song.""

While shooting the video, Demi joked on Twitter about having to get intimate with her co-star, whom she had met not long before cameras started rolling. ""It's kind of funny. It's part of the job though. You just try to get through it, but it is kind of awkward at first when you have to act like a couple with someone that you don't know,"" she said. ""He was really sweet, really sweet and really cute.""

The song has the somewhat dubious distinction of being the first to reach #1 on Billboard's Pop Songs chart whilst falling short of the Hot 100's top 10, since the eligibility rules for the latter tally changed in December 1998. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Demi+Lovato/_/Give+Your+Heart+a+Break"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Maggie’s Song Lyrics
According to Chris Stapleton via NPR:

“I wrote [Maggie’s Song] the day after our dog, Maggie, passed away. We had her for 14 years and I miss her quite a bit. I’m not really a dog person, either, that’s…

[Verse 1]
Let me tell you a story
About an old friend of mine
Somebody left her in a shopping cart
In a parking lot for us to find
Just a fuzzy black pup
She was hungry and feeling alone
We put her in the back seat
And told her we were takin' her home
[Chorus]
Run, Maggie run
With the heart of a rebel child
Oh, run, Maggie run
Be just as free as you are wild
[Verse 2]
A few kids later
We moved out on the farm
And she followed those kids around
Yeah, she kept them safe from harm
And she loved to chase squirrels
And playin' out in the snow
She'd take off like a bullet
Man, you should have seen her go[Chorus]
Run, Maggie run
With the heart of a rebel child
Oh, run, Maggie run
Be just as free as you are wild
[Verse 3]
It was rainin' on a Monday
The day that Maggie died
She woke up and couldn't use her legs
So I laid down by her side
She put her head on my hand
Like she'd done so many times
I told her she was a good dog
Then I told her goodbye
[Chorus]
Run, Maggie run
With the heart of a rebel child
Oh, run, Maggie run
Be just as free as you are wild
[Verse 4]
I had a revelation
As the tractor dug a hole
I can tell you right now
That a dog has a soul
And I thought to myself
As we buried her on the hill
I never knew me a better dog
And I guess I never will[Chorus]
Run, Maggie run
With the heart of a rebel child
Oh, run, Maggie run
Be just as free as you are wild
Oh, run, Maggie run
With the heart of a rebel child
Oh, run, Maggie run
Be just as free as you are wild",https://genius.com/Chris-stapleton-maggies-song-lyrics,"",""

Stained Glass Lyrics
“Stained Glass” is the first promotional single from Madison Beer’s upcoming debut album. She sang the full version on a live stream on Billboard’s Facebook account on March 23, 2020.
[Verse 1]
Lately, I'm countin' the minutes that I've got left
And lately, I'm countin' the words that I haven't said
'Cause you will never know what I been through
And you should be a little more gentle
But maybe I need to start taking my own advice
'Cause my heart's so heavy, it's ready to fall out twice
'Cause you will never know what I been through
So you should be a little more gentle with me
[Chorus]
My skin is made of glass
But apparently it's stained
'Cause you notice all the cracks
But can't look inside my pain
And if you throw another stone
Then I'd stay far away, far away
I just might break
[Verse 2]
My life's just a faded memory of what I can't have
And everythin' 'round me is starting to fade into black, mmm
But black and white is so much better
I'm learning how to hide my colors
You shoulda been a little more gentle with me[Chorus]
My skin is made of glass
But apparently it's stained
'Cause you notice all the cracks
But can't look inside my pain
And if you throw another stone
Then I'd stay far away, far away
I just might break
[Bridge]
Break
Break, mmm
Hey, might break
Might break, mmm
[Chorus]
My skin is made of glass
But apparently it's stained
'Cause you notice all the cracks
But can't look inside my pain
And if you throw another stone
Then I'd stay far away, far away
I just might break",https://genius.com/Madison-beer-stained-glass-lyrics,"“Stained Glass“ is the third single from Madison Beer's debut studio album, Life Support.

[Verse 1]
Feeling like I'm breathing my last breath
Feeling like I'm walking my last steps
Look at all of these tears I've wept
Look at all the promises that I've kept
[Pre-Chorus]
I put my all into your hands
Here's my soul to keep
I let you in with all that I can
You're not hard to reach
[Chorus]
And you bless me with the best gift
That I've ever known
You give me purpose
Yeah, you've given me purpose
[Verse 2]
Thinking my journey's come to an end
Sending out a farewell to my friends, for inner peace
Ask you to forgive me for my sins, oh would you please?
I'm more than grateful for the time we spent, my spirit's at ease
[Pre-Chorus]
I put my heart into your hands
Learn the lessons you teach
No matter when, wherever I am
You're not hard to reach[Chorus]
And you've given me the best gift
That I've ever known
You give me purpose everyday
You give me purpose in every way
[Bridge]
Oh, you are my everything
Oh, you are my everything
[Outro (Spoken)]
I don’t know if this is wrong, because someone else is telling me that it’s wrong. But I feel this so let me just like try my best not to let this happen again.  We weren’t necessarily put in the best position to make the best decisions
You can’t be hard on yourself for it, these are the cards you were given so you have to understand that’s not who you are. You know you’re trying to be the best you can be, but that’s all you can do. If you don’t give it all you got, you’re only cheating yourself give it all you got but if it ends up happening, it ends up happening
That’s what happening with me, it’s like “God, I’m giving it all I’ve got, sometimes I’m weak and I’m going to do it.” And it’s like I’m not giving myself grace, I’m just like understanding that’s how it is",https://genius.com/Justin-bieber-purpose-lyrics,"Justin Bieber shows there’s art in resilience on his fourth studio album.

Changes Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Some days I move like water
Some days I burn like fire
Some days I wanna push further
Some days I wanna do nothin', and

I just wanna be the best of me

So that I can be the best for you

Though I'm goin' through changes

Sometimes I smile like it's all good
Even though there's pain underneath it

I just wanna be the best of me
Even though sometimes I forget to breathe
So that I can be the best for you
That's all I wanna do[Chorus]

Though I'm goin' through changes
Don't mean that I'll change

And if you’re not going to give up the only thing to do is push forward."" - via Billboard (2020)

Throughout the song, Bieber keeps the same subject, talking about different circumstances in life. His message states that he is going through changes, like he says in the chorus. In the outro, Bieber states that people change. An example of a change is the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic in the world. However, at the time of this song’s release, it was not a pandemic. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Justin+Bieber/_/Changes"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

[Verse 1: Niall]
We made a fire, went down in the flames
We sailed an ocean and drowned in the wave
Built a cathedral, but we never prayed
We had it all, yeah, and we walked away

Point of no return and now it's just too late to turn around
I try to forgive you but I struggle 'cause I don't know how
We built it up so high and now I'm falling
It's a long way down, it's a long way down from here

We had a mountain, but took it for granted
We had a spaceship, but we couldn't land it
We found an island, but we got stranded
We had it all, yeah, who could've planned it?

the last great american dynasty Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny
Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis
Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money
And the town said, ""How did a middle-class divorcée do it?""
The wedding was charming, if a little gauche
There's only so far new money goes
They picked out a home and called it ""Holiday House""
Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud
The doctor had told him to settle down
It must have been her fault his heart gave out
[Chorus]
And they said
""There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything""
[Verse 2]
Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever
Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city
Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
And losing on card game bets with Dalí[Chorus]
And they said
""There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything""
[Bridge]
They say she was seen on occasion
Pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea
And in a feud with her neighbor
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
Fifty years is a long time
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach
Free of women with madness, their men and bad habits
And then it was bought by me
[Chorus]
Who knows, if I never showed up, what could've been
There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen
I had a marvelous time ruining everything
[Outro]
I had a marvelous time ruining everything
A marvelous time ruining everything
A marvelous time
I had a marvelous time",https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-the-last-great-american-dynasty-lyrics,"""the last great american dynasty"" is the third track from Taylor Swift’s eighth studio album, folklore.

It was released on July 24, 2020, through Republic Records. This song was confirmed on Taylor’s social media accounts on July 23, 2020.

“the last great american dynasty” follows the story of Rebekah Harkness, a patron of the arts, and founder of the Rebekah Harkness Foundation. In 2013, Swift bought a Rhode Island mansion once owned by Rebekah Harkness. The mansion is known as “Holiday House.”

Taylor draws subtle comparisons between herself and Rebekah Harkness in the song. She likens her star-studded parties to the bevy of famous composers and and dancers that once frequented Holiday house in Harkness' days. Also similar to Taylor Swift, Rebekah Harkness was often a target of harsh criticism from the tabloids, and people alike.

This song is reminiscent of “The Lucky One” from her album ""Red"" where Taylor Swift sang of an unnamed Hollywood star who moved away from the limelight and from under the microscope of the media, into a life of solitude.

The style of the song follows Taylor Swift’s familiar contemporary pop sound. She spends most of the song singing in a low octave, transitioning to a higher octave only towards the end of the song. The song has elements of folk music in it too, matching the overall theme of the album.

Swift told People in March 2021:

""I’m really proud of [the lyric] ‘She had a marvelous time ruining everything’ from ""the last great american dynasty"" because it’s about what happens when women step out of their cages and run. It can be a real pearl-clutching moment for society when a woman owns her desires and wildness. And I love the idea that the woman in question would be too joyful in her freedom to even care that she’s ruffling feathers, raising eyebrows or becoming the talk of the town. The idea that she decided there were marvelous times to be had, and that was more important.""

“the last great american dynasty” debuted at #13 on the Billboard Hot 100 during the chart week of August 8, 2020. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Swift/_/tHe+LaSt+GrEaT+aMeRiCaN+dYnAsTy"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

[Verse 1]
Locked up tight
Like I would never feel again
Stuck in some kind of love prison
And threw away the key
Oh, oh
Terrified
Until I stared into your eyes
Made me start to realize the possibilities
So, so

[Intro]
Ah-one, two, three, four
[Verse 1]
Who needs a house up on a hill
When you can have one on four wheels
And take it anywhere the wind might blow?
You don't ever have to mow the yard
Just hang a map and throw a dart
And pray to God the engine starts and go
[Chorus 1]
Water and electric
And a place to drain the septic
Any K.O.A. is A-OK, as long as I'm with you
So come on, hitch your wagon
To the living room I'm draggin'
If I can't bring you to my house, I'll bring my house to you
[Verse 2]
Parking lots and county lines
And countin' mile marker signs
Where the buffalo and antelope all roam
Greetings from Niagara Falls
One more postcard for the wall
Off in our own sweet home away from home[Chorus 1]
Water and electric
And a place to drain the septic
Any K.O.A. is A-OK, as long as I'm with you
So come on, hitch your wagon
To the living room I'm draggin'
If I can't bring you to my house, I'll bring my house to you
[Bridge]
In Washington, in Idaho
In Oregon, and away we go
To Tennessee and Arkansas
No, we won't stop 'til we've seen 'em all
'Til we've seen 'em all
[Chorus 2]
So what else could you ask for?
You don't even need a passport
To see the whole world from our living room
So come on, hitch your wagon
To the happiness I'm draggin'
If I can't bring you to my house, I'll bring my house to you
If I can't bring you to my house, I'll bring my house to you
[Outro]
It don't matter where we go
We'll never be alone
Anywhere beside you is a place that I'll call home
It don't matter where we go
We'll never be alone
Anywhere beside you is a place that I'll call home",https://genius.com/Kacey-musgraves-my-house-lyrics,"",""

[Verse 1]
I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your war path
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind trying to get it back
[Pre-Chorus]
Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
And everybody believed in you?
[Chorus]
It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me, oh
Who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent
[Verse 2]
Did some things you can't speak of
But at night, you live it all again
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then
[Pre-Chorus]
Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catching days?
When everything out of reach
Someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful running wild 'til you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up to you?[Chorus]
It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me, oh
Who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, life is a tough crowd
Thirty-two and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent
[Bridge]
Time turns flames to embers
You'll have new Septembers
Every one of us has messed up, too, ooh
Minds change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never too late to be brand new, oh
[Chorus]
It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me, oh
Who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, life is a tough crowd
Thirty-two and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent[Outro]
Lost your balance on a tightrope, oh
It's never too late to get it back",https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-innocent-lyrics,"According to the Innocent Songfacts, this song is about someone who has lost his path their life, but whose ""streaming lights are bright to me.""

""The song ""Innocent"" is about something that really intensely affected me emotionally. It took a while to write this one. I was fortunate enough to get a chance to perform this song on the VMAs, and that's the first time that anyone ever heard it. Putting out an album called Speak Now where you're supposed to say what you feel when you know how you feel, I felt that performing that song on that particular award show was appropriate.

Standin' on the corner, smokin' that grass
And the boys all pass me by
Talkin' some shit with your hand on my ass
I'm a murderer in disguise
Yeah, you wanna be cool, but you're makin' me mad
Bite my lip, it starts to bleed
Yeah, it tastes so good,
 but I gotta be bad
If I'm gonna get you home

Gonna make the curtains cream, believe it
Gonna make the ceilin' shake for me
I'ma be your full-time 
bedroom demon
I'm gonna make you scream, that's a matter of fact
I'll be your fantasy

And, boy, you're gonna die tonight

Killah[Verse 2]
I'm lightin' up my final cigarette
I'll burn a hole right through your eyes
Lookin' at you like a 
zombie killah
Hungry for a homicide
If I get you alone under your skin and bone
I'ma try you on for size
I'm 'bout to wear you out like my favorite suit
Wools paralyzed

Gonna make the curtains cream, believe it
Gonna make the ceiling shake for me
I'ma be your full-time bedroom demon

[Verse 1]
I'm five years old, it's getting cold, I've got my big coat on
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
Look now, the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home
[Chorus]
I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today
[Verse 2]
I'm thirteen now
And don't know how my friends could be so mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names
[Chorus]
I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school
But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today[Bridge]
I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother, inside and out
He's better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
And I had the best days with you
[Verse 3]
There is a video I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs
And Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world
[Chorus]
And now, I know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
For staying back and watching me shine
And I didn't know if you knew, so I'm taking this chance to say
That I had the best day with you today",https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-the-best-day-lyrics,"Swift wrote “The Best Day” about her mother, Andrea Swift, and the good effects her mother had on her growing up.

Swift also said to CMT News:

My mom and I are closer than ever. Out in the big world, I’ve learned to appreciate my mom. I realize how smart she is. I know my mom knows more than I do. Our arguments become discussions.

[Verse 1]
He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear and it's like
I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says you look beautiful tonight
And I feel perfectly fine
[Chorus]
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you
[Verse 2]
He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable[Chorus]
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you
[Bridge]
He can't see the smile I'm faking
And my heart's not breaking
'Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating
Intoxicating, complicated
Got away by some mistake and now
[Chorus]
I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
It's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
I'm so in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone

[Verse 1]
I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, ""This is it, I've had enough,"" 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space (What?)
Then you come around again and say
""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me""
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, ""I love you""
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
We called it off again last night, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you
[Chorus]
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
Like, ever
[Verse 2]
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You called me up again tonight, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you
[Chorus]
We (We) are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (Talk to me)
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah)
Oh-oh-oh
[Bridge]
I used to think that we were forever, ever
And I used to say, ""Never say never""
Ugh, so he calls me up and he's like, ""I still love you""
And I'm like, ""I just, I mean, this is exhausting, you know?
Like, we are never getting back together, like, ever""
[Chorus]
(No) We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever (Ooh) getting back together

It was written by Swift with the song's co-producers Max Martin and Shellback. It was released as the lead single from Swift's upcoming fourth studio album Red (2012) on August 14, 2012 by Big Machine Records. The We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together Songfacts reports that the song was Taylor's first ever #1 on the American Hot 100.

After writing Speak Now (2010) entirely solo <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Swift/_/We+Are+Never+Ever+Getting+Back+Together"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","""We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together"" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. It was written by Swift with the song's co-producers Max Martin and Shellback. It was released as the lead single from Swift's upcoming fourth studio album Red (2012) on August 14, 2012 by Big Machine Records. The We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together Songfacts reports that the song was Taylor's first ever #1 on the American Hot 100.

After writing Speak Now (2010) entirely solo, she opted to collaborate with different songwriters and producers for Red. Thus, she called Max Martin and Shellback, two songwriters and producers whose work she admired fondly, to discuss a possible collaboration. The trio conceived the concept for ""We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together"" incidentally after a friend of Swift's ex-boyfriend walked into the recording studio and spoke of rumors he heard that Swift and her former flame were reuniting. With the friend gone, Martin and Shellback asked Swift to elaborate on the details of the relationship, which she described as ""break up, get back together, break up, get back together, just, ugh, the worst"". Martin then suggested that they write about the incident. Swift began playing the guitar and singing, ""We are never..."", and the song flowed rapidly afterwards. She described the process as one of the most humorous experiences she had while recording, and said the musical partners matched her expectations.

I'm the next act waiting in the wings
I'm an animal trapped in your hot car
I am all the days that you choose to ignore

You are all I need
You're all I need
I'm in the middle of your picture
Lying in the reeds

I am a moth who just wants to share your light
I'm just an insect trying to get out of the night
I only stick with you because there are no others

The recording also incorporates a full string section, a synthesizer, and various other instruments into its instrumentation. Lead guitarist Jonny Greenwood utilized a string section in order to produce the desired effect of white noise produced by a band playing loudly in a room. Prior to its official release on In Rainbows, the song was debuted live by Radiohead at a Chicago, Illinois concert in June 2006.

In support of the MTV EXIT anti-human trafficking campaign, Radiohead produced a video for ""All I Need"", directed by Steve Rogers, which premiered on May 1, 2008. The clip, which contrasts the lives of two young boys—an average, well-off child from a developed environment, and a sweatshop worker—received critical acclaim and won numerous awards. On January 5, 2009, ""All I Need"" impacted the United States adult album alternative radio as the fifth and final single from In Rainbows. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/_/All+I+Need"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

If I Can’t Lyrics
Don’t be fooled by the party beat, “If I Can’t” is all about 50 Cent’s authenticity as a gangsta. If 50 Cent isn’t capable of doing something, it is simply not possible to do.

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Yeah
Haha, yeah
Yeah
[Chorus: 50 Cent]
If I can't do it, homie
It can't be done
Now I'ma let the champagne bottle pop, I'ma take it to the top
For sure, I'ma make it hot, baby (Baby)
[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I apply pressure to pussies, they stunt and I pop (Yeah)
Stand alone squeezing my pistol,
 I'm sure that I got 'em (Uh-huh)
Now, Peter Piper picked peppers, and Run rocked rhymes
I'm 50 Cent, I write a little bit, but I pop nines (Brrat)
Tell niggas get they money right, 'cause I got mine (Uh-huh)
And I'm around, quit playing, nigga, you can't shine (Woo)
You gon' be that next chump to end up in the trunk
After being hit by 
the pump
, is that what you want?
Be easy, nigga, I'll lay your ass out
Believe me, nigga, that's what I'm about
Gangsta, you could find a nigga sitting on chrome
Hit the clutch, hit the gear, hit the gas and I'm gone (Yeah)
[Chorus: 50 Cent]
If I can't do it, homie
It can't be done
Now, I'ma let the champagne bottle pop, I'ma take it to the top
For sure, I'ma make it hot, baby (Baby)[Verse 2: 50 Cent & 
Dr. Dre

I'm down for the action, he smart with his mouth, so smack him (Woo)
You holding a strap, he might come back, so clap him (Yeah)
React like a gangsta, or die like a gangsta for acting (C'mon)
'Cause you'll get hit and homicide'll be asking, ""What happened?""
Oh no, look who crept in with the .44
Twenty-inch rims sitting on low-pros (Uh-huh)
East side, west side, niggas know, yo, I'm loco (Yeah)
Even my mama said something really wrong with my brain
Niggas don't rob me, they know I'm down to die for my chain
G-Unit (Yeah), we get it popping in the hood
G-Unit (Yeah), motherfucker, what's good?
I'm waiting on niggas to act like they don't know how to act (Uh-huh)
After sippin' too much Jack, I'll blow 'em off the map
With the MAC, thinking it's all rap
'Til that ass get clapped and Doc say, ""It's a wrap"" (
It's a wrap, nigga
)
[Chorus: 50 Cent]

It can't be done
Now, I'ma let the champagne bottle pop (Uh-huh), I'ma take it to the top
For sure, I'ma make it hot, baby (Baby)
[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
I invented how to teach lessons to slow learners
Go ahead, act up, get smacked in the head with the burner (Ah)
I don't fight fair, I'm dirty, dirty
I'm from Southside Jamaica, Queens, nigga, you heard me? (Yeah)
When the streetlights come on, niggas blast the nines (Uh-huh)
Get locked up, then read books to pass the time (Woo)
In the game, there's ups and downs, so I stay on the grind
Niggas on my dick more than my bitch, I stay on they mind
There ain't nothing they could do to stop my shine (Uh-uh)
This is God's plan, homie, this ain't mine
I played the music loud so Grandpa called me a nuisance
And Grandma always gotta throw in her two cents
I'm the dropout who made more money than his teachers
Roofless like the coupe, but I come with more features
I am what I am, you can like it or love it
It feels good to blow fifty grand and think nothing of it, fuck it[Chorus: 50 Cent]
If I can't do it, homie
It can't be done
Now I'ma let the champagne bottle pop, I'ma take it to the top
For sure, I'ma make it hot, baby (Baby)
If I can't do it, homie
It can't be done
 (Haha)
Now I'ma let the champagne bottle pop, I'ma take it to the top (Yeah)
For sure I'ma make it hot, baby (Baby)

Bang Bang Lyrics
The twenty-first track on Dr. Dre’s album 2001, Dre, Knoc-Turn'al, and Hittman reflect on violence within the hood, and the bleak reality of what has to be done in poor communities to survive.
[Chorus: T. Y. Nichols]
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
[Verse 1: Dr. Dre & 
Eminem
]
Everyday it's the same thing, L.A. ain't changed
Niggas still playa hating, but Dre ain't changed
I'm just a lot smarter now
'Cause these niggas is banging ten times harder now
Niggas bringing they ass up in the wrong part of town
Better turn their car around
Rolling the window down (
Hey, can we talk it out?
)
(Nah, get the fuck out!)
Johnny got a shotgun
And he ain't even strong enough to cock one
Fuck trying to job hunt
Niggas got AK's
Niggas is way crazier than Dre was back in his N.W.A. days
Niggas spray strays and shoot without looking
Niggas walk by and blast, without leaving a footprint
I think the attitudes are twice as worse
It takes half the time to get your whole life reversed
Always trying to play Rambo with they ammo
Make a nigga wanna stay in family mode[Chorus: T. Y. Nichols]
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
(BANG BANG!!)
[Verse 2: Knoc-turn'al]
Late nights is full of lead that whistles as it goes by
Murder arrives, anytime
Bullets take flight when the 
fo'-five
 ignites
Some hearts skip a beat, some get blew out, and never re-light
With you in the sight of youngsters with automatics
Busting on shit to lay everything down, even tourists to non-affiliates
These days, gunplay is official, with green lights on every block
Though the sign tells you to, it's not best to stop
On every corner, Cali niggas are dumping
You'll be shaking your soul loose from the box at the coroner's
Making death not so foreign to ya
Niggas got Rugers and M14's with enough ammo to leave
An armored truck Swiss cheese
I've learned to stay away from house parties
I've seen too many go and end up absent without leave
Ain't no warm welcomings
My eyes have witnessed the endin' on
Nights that don't sleep, and fireworks until dawn[Chorus: T. Y. Nichols]
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
(BANG BANG!!)
[Verse 3: Hittman]
Now tell me, what the fuck is this, man?
Niggas doing brothers in worse than the Klan
Can't even stand
In front of your building and chill without yielding
Twelve year old children that kill, blood spilling
Thugs be illing, unnecessary slugs filling the sky
Usually drilling the one that wasn't willing to die
Yes sir, in the Killing Field
, I got my life preserver
And I'll do my time for murder
These niggas got the nerve to question me
'Bout the colors that I got on?
I see that red dot on your knot, 'bout to get your whole crew shot on
A Soldier of Fortune,
 I'm the wrong man to plot on
Took him out on the spot before he even got on my hit list
Peep this –
I cock back, you bow down
Bust round, bloody the ground
Retaliation sounds like this:[Chorus: T. Y. Nichols]
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is

No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is

​good wife Lyrics
[Intro]
Let's go back to the beginning
I just wanna be a good wife
[Verse 1]
Wake him up nice and slow, bring coffee in bed
Listen to his problems, tell him that I understand
Touch him so he knows in his heart he's the only one
Try to loosen up and be more fun, yeah, I could be more fun
[Chorus]
God, help me be a good wife
'Cause he needs me
Even when he's not right
He still needs me
[Verse 2]
Help me let go of all the things that make me mad
At the еnd of the day, he's gotta know that I've got his back
And if hе comes home stressed out, I could pack him a bowl
Just let him be himself, don't try to control
[Chorus]
God, help me be a good wife
'Cause he needs me
And even when he's not right
Yeah, he still needs me[Bridge]
And the truth is
I could probably make it on my own
But without him
This house just wouldn't be a home
And I don't wanna be alone
[Chorus]
God, help me be a good wife
Yeah, 'cause he needs me, oh
And even when he's not right
I know he still needs me
Help me be a good wife

[Verse 1]
It's not you, it's the glow of the party
The way that you've got me lit up inside
It's the song that they're playin', the words that you're sayin'
It's never felt so right
[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm the kind of person who starts getting kinda nervous
When I'm having the time of my life
[Chorus]
Is there a word for the way that I'm feeling tonight?
Happy and sad at the same time
You got me smiling with tears in my eyes
I never felt so high
No, I've never been this far off of the ground
And they say everything that goes up must come down
But I don't wanna come down
[Verse 2]
So is there a way to stop all this thinkin', just keep on drinkin'?
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
When they're turnin' the lights on and it turns out the joke's on me

I never felt so high
No, I've never been this far off of the ground
And they say everything that goes up must come down
I don't wanna come down
[Bridge]
I don't mind at all, no, I'm used to fallin'
I'm comfortable when the sky is gray
But when everything is perfect, I start hidin'
'Cause I know that rain is comin' my way, my way

'Cause I'm happy and sad at the same time
You got me smilin' with tears in my eyes
I never felt so high

Remain in Me Lyrics

She was in my eyes
In  the same disguise

They'll remain in me
I'll wait 'til I'm old enough to give away

When the souls meet
I'll remain in me
They'll remain in me
And if I was gone
Then I'm lost
They'll break your heart
They'll take what's hers
And they'll never burn
They could never burn
They could never burn
They will never die
They will never dieThey could never die",https://genius.com/Peter-cat-recording-co-remain-in-me-lyrics,"",""

[Verse 1]
Baby love, I think I've been a little too kind
Didn't notice you walkin' all over my peace of mind
In the shoes I gave you as a present
Puttin' someone first only works when you're in their top five
And by the way, I'm goin' out tonight
[Chorus]
Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask, ""Do you have a man?""
I could still say, 
""I don't remember""
Familiarity breeds contempt
Don't put mе in the basement
Whеn I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real, I polish up real nice
[Post-Chorus]
Nice
[Verse 2]
Baby boy, I think I've been too good of a girl (Too good of a girl)
Did all the extra credit, then got graded on a curve
I think it's time to teach some lessons
I made you my world (Huh), have you heard? (Huh)
I can reclaim the land
And I miss you (Miss you), but I miss sparklin' (Nice)[Chorus]
Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask, ""Do you have a man?""
I could still say, ""I don't remember""
Familiarity breeds contempt
Don't put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real, I polish up real nice
[Post-Chorus]
Nice
[Bridge]
Sapphire tears on my face
Sadness became my whole sky
But some guy said my aura's moonstone
Just 'cause he was high
And we're dancin' all night
And you can try to change my mind
But you might have to wait in line
What's a girl gonna do?
A diamond's gotta shine[Chorus]
Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer (Shimmer)
And when I meet the band
They ask, ""Do you have a man?""
I could still say, ""I don't remember""
Familiarity breeds contempt
Don't put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real (Nice), I polish up real nice

Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band Lyrics
The opening track from the ubiquitous concept album, Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, introduces the fictional band and leads into the Ringo-fronted “With A Little Help From My Friends.”
[Intro]
(*People talking*)
[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
It was twenty years ago today
When Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play
They've been going in and out of style
But they're guaranteed to raise a smile
So may I introduce to you
The act you've known for all these years
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
[Interlude]
(*Applauding*)
(*People laughing*)
[Chorus: Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison & Ringo Starr]
We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We hope you will enjoy the show
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
Sit back and let the evening go
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
[Bridge: Paul McCartney, John Lennon & George Harrison]
It's wonderful to be here
It's certainly a thrill
You're such a lovely audience
We'd like to take you home with us
We'd love to take you home[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
I don't really want to stop the show
But I thought you might like to know
That the singer's going to sing a song
And he wants you all to sing along
So let me introduce to you
The one and only Billy Shears
And Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, yeah

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, appearing as the opening and penultimate track.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" is a song written by Paul McCartney (credited to Lennon/McCartney) and recorded by The Beatles for their 1967 album  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, appearing as the opening and penultimate track.

Authorship and recording

In November 1966, on the flight back to England after a holiday, McCartney conceived an idea in which an entire album would be role-played, with each of The Beatles assuming an alter-ego in the ""Lonely Hearts Club Band"", which would then perform a concert in front of an audience. The inspiration is said to have come when roadie Mal Evans innocently asked McCartney what the letters “S” and “P” stood for on the pots on their in-flight meal trays, and McCartney explained it was for salt and pepper. This then led to the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band concept, as well as the song. According to producer George Martin, the song was recorded before the album, but he also said that it started the idea of a concept album based around the main Sgt. Pepper character.

The group's road manager Neil Aspinall suggested the idea of Sergeant Pepper being the compère, as well as the reprise at the end of the album. According to his diaries, Evans may have also contributed to the song. John Lennon attributed the idea for Sgt. Pepper to McCartney, although the song is officially credited to Lennon/McCartney. The song was recorded in Abbey Road's number 2 studio, with Martin producing, and Geoff Emerick engineering. Work on the song started on 1 February 1967, and after three further sessions the recording was complete on 6 March 1967.

Song structure

On the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album, the song opens to the sound of a chattering audience, and an orchestra tuning up, which was taken from the 10 February orchestra session for ""A Day in the Life"". The crowd sounds edited into the song were recorded in the early '60s by Martin, during a live recording of the stage show Beyond the Fringe. When the song itself begins, the band introduces its members. The song's structure is:

Introduction (instrumental) 
Verse 
Bridge (instrumental) 
Refrain 
Bridge 
Verse 
Instrumental bridge and transition into ""With a Little Help from My Friends"". 

The song is in G major, with a 4/4 meter. A horn quartet was used to fill out the instrumental sections. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/Sgt.+Pepper%27s+Lonely+Hearts+Club+Band"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Like many of the songs on the album, ""Where Were You in the Morning?"" is a collaboration with Teddy Geiger, Geoff Warbuton and Scott Harris. It was during the penning of the soulful tune in 2017 that Shawn discovered how to hit the high notes that he uses during the record.

""Technically... last year, I couldn't sing falsetto,"" he told Entertainment Weekly: ""I figured out how to the day I wrote Where Were You In the Morning.

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Y'all know me, still the same OG
But I been low-key
Hated on by most these niggas
With no cheese, no deals and no G's
No wheels and no keys
No boats, no snowmobiles, and no skis
Mad at me, 'cause I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hangin' up in the office and back at my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze? Ho, please
You better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees?
Who you think brought you the oldies?
Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's, and D.O.C.'s
The Snoop D-O-double-Gs
And the group that said, ""Motherfuck the police""
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales wasn't doin' too good
Who's the Doctor they told you to go see?
Y'all better listen up closely
All you niggas that said that I turned pop or The Firm flopped
Y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been gettin' no sleep
So fuck y'all, all of y'all
If y'all don't like me, blow me
Y'all are gon' keep fuckin' around with me and turn me back to the old me[Chorus: Eminem]
Nowadays, everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
Nowadays, everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
[Verse 2: Eminem]
So what do you say to somebody you hate (What?)
Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way?
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way? (Yup)
Just study a tape of N.W.A
One day I was walkin' by
With a Walkman on, when I caught a guy
Gave me an awkward eye ('Chu lookin' at?)
And strangled him up in the parking lot with his Karl Kani
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge
When I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage
Hoppin' out with two broken legs tryna walk it off
Fuck you too, bitch, call the cops
I'ma kill you and them loud-ass motherfuckin' barkin' dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt-down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still weren't found out (Right here)
So from here on out, it's the Chronic II
Startin' today and tomorrow's anew
And I'm still loco enough to choke you to death with a Charleston Chew
Chicka-chicka-chicka Slim Shady
Hotter than a set of twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up
When the temp goes up to the mid-80s
Callin' men ladies
Sorry Doc, but I been crazy
There's no way that you can save me
It's okay, go with him, Hailie (
Dada?
)[Chorus: Eminem]
Nowadays, everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
Nowadays, everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
If it was up to me, you motherfuckers'd stop
Comin' up to me with your hands out
Lookin' up to me like you want somethin' free
When my last CD was out, you wasn't bumpin' me
But now that I got this little company
Everybody wanna come to me
Like it was some disease, but you won't get a crumb from me
'Cause I'm from the streets of 
C-Compton
 (
Compton
)
I told 'em all
All 'em little gangstas, who you think helped mold 'em all?
Now you wanna run around talkin' 'bout guns like I ain't got none
What, you think I sold 'em all
'Cause I stay well off?
Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin' Dre fell off
What, 'cause I been in the lab
With a pen and a pad 
tryin' to get this damn label off?
I ain't havin' that
This is the millennium of Aftermath
It ain't gon' be nothin' after that
So give me one more platinum plaque
And fuck rap, you can have it back
So where's all the Mad Rappers at?
It's like a jungle in this habitat
But all you savage cats know that I was strapped with gats
While you were cuddlin' a Cabbage Patch[Chorus: Eminem]
Nowadays, everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
Nowadays, everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips

So this is just a response to that. That’s all it is. Period.""

Eminem not only features on the track, he also wrote almost all of the lyrics, including the majority of Dre’s verses. This is rather obvious given the rapid flow, jam-packed with multisyllabic assonance—a marked departure from Dre’s usual style. Dre talked about how the song came together:

""This is actually one of the few times where the lyrics were written before the track. Eminem actually wrote that. He came in and was like, ‘I got this song I wrote for you.’ So, we had the problem of trying to figure out what the track was gonna be to the lyrics, and it was a little bit difficult because I’m doing it that way. But we made it happen.""

The single peaked at #25 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and #3 on the Rhythmic Top 40 charts, while also achieving platinum status in the United Kingdom. This track brought in a Grammy for Best Rap Performance By A Duo Or Group in 2001 and also won for Best Rap Video at the MTV Video Music Awards in 2000. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Dr.+Dre/_/Forgot+About+Dre"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Montage_ (English Ver.) Lyrics
[Intro: CyA]
Hoping you flow in my light sleep
[Verse 1: Yonghoon, 
Dongmyeong
]
The pieces of the broken scene, let's count them one by one
I'm trying to assemble the blurred montage, set back
The fine line in between the dream and reality
I hope you come and stay with me, won't you?
[Pre-Chorus: CyA, 
Dongmyeong
]
You know what
When I open my eyes, you keep coming up
Even on this night, when I really miss you
It's hard for me to go to sleep
Even though it's all a lie
Please come closer to me
North, south, east, west, love lost on the road
Lost in my dreams
[Chorus: Yonghoon, 
Dongmyeong
]
Although the night fades away
With all my love, I'm telling you
Between the sky and the clouds
Just when it shines on us
And no matter where you look
I'll be standing right here for you
You can come
And find me whenever[Post-Chorus: CyA]
Yeah
Yeah (Hey)
[Verse 2: CyA]
Remember me, last night your smile trapped me away
Can't get over it, away
Stir my hands, wave, I won't let you go
The safari, midst of thoughts, oh, yeah
Love me again like the way we've always loved each other
Let me be yours and only yours like the daybreak
The night we spent, tonight, it's not too late
Hoping you flow in my light sleep
[Pre-Chorus: Dongmyeong, 
CyA

You know what?
When I open my eyes, you keep coming up
Even on this night, when I really miss you

Yonghoon

Early morning, where your traces are left
I filled the locks of the dreamy dream just for a moment, yeah
On a night I was lost, you held onto my hand
Before everything disappears again
Woah, ooh

Hope You Know Lyrics
[Intro]

I, I-I love you

Every great achievement began with a spark of determination
Often ignited by the very doubts meant to stop you
Keep pushing forward

[Interlude: Diana Garland]
When we're all born, Saturn's somewhere
And the Saturn cycle takes around about twenty-nine years
That's when we gotta wake up and smell the coffee
Because if we've just been sort of relying on our cleverness
Or relying—, you know, just kind of floating along
Saturn comes along and hits you over the head
Hits you over the head, hits you over the head, and says, ""Wake up""
Aha, it's time for you to get real about life and sort out who you really are
[Outro]
Wake up
Get real",https://genius.com/Ariana-grande-saturn-returns-interlude-lyrics,"The spoken track, “Saturn Returns Interlude”, goes into the lessons of a Saturn Return. A Saturn Return happens approximately every 29.5 years, when Saturn completes a full rotation around the sun, returning to the exact placement it was on your birthday.

Mutual Lyrics
The simple guitar- and drum-laden thematic of “Mutual” is underscored by its simple message: If you don’t love back, leaving may be the only option.
[Verse 1]
I want you close to me
I want you close, I want you closer
But when you're here with me
It's hard to tell just what you're after
[Pre-Chorus]
You say you want all of me today
But tomorrow's not the same
My feelings never change
What do you want from me?
What do you want, uh?
[Chorus]
I need to know
If this is mutual
Before I go
And get way too involved
I want you bad
Can you reciprocate?
No, I don't want to have to leave
But half of you's not enough for me
[Verse 2]
This inconsistency, what does it mean?
You got me questioning, the way you act and take it back
Do I mean anything?
Just tell me honestly[Pre-Chorus]
You say you want all of me today
But tomorrow's not the same
My feelings never change
What do you want from me?
What do you want, uh?
[Chorus]
I need to know
If this is mutual
Before I go
And get way too involved
I want you bad
Can you reciprocate?
No, I don't want to have to leave
But half of you's not enough for me
[Bridge]
Are you playin' me, is this a game?
When you show up late, say love at 2 A.M
Then tell me you can't stay, girl, yeah
What do you want from me?
Baby, oh
[Chorus]
I need to know
If this is mutual
Before I go
And get way too involved
I want you bad, baby
Can you reciprocate?
No, I don't want to have to leave
But half of you's not enough for me",https://genius.com/Shawn-mendes-mutual-lyrics,"",""

[Verse 1]
Green was the color of the grass
Where I used to read at Centennial Park
I used to think I would meet somebody there
Teal was the color of your shirt
When you were sixteen at the yogurt shop
You used to work at to make a little money
[Chorus]
Time, curious time
Gave me no compasses, gave me no signs
Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
[Verse 2]
Bad was the blood of the song in the cab
On your first trip to LA
You ate at my favorite spot for dinner
Bold was the waitress on our three-year trip
Getting lunch down by the Lakes
She said I looked like an American singer[Chorus]
Time, mystical time
Cutting me open, then healing me fine
Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
[Bridge]
A string that pulled me
Out of all the wrong arms, right into that dive bar
Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire
Chains around my demons
Wool to brave the seasons
One single thread of gold
Tied me to you
[Verse 3]
Cold was the steel of my axe to grind
For the boys who broke my heart
Now I send their babies presents
Gold was the color of the leaves
When I showed you around Centennial Park
Hell was the journey, but it brought me heaven[Chorus]
Time, wondrous time
Gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies
And it's cool, baby, with me
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Me

​there is a light Lyrics
[Intro]
There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light inside of me

Tried not to show it
To make you feel good
Pretended I couldn't
When you knew that I could
[Pre-Chorus]
I won't cry when the cold wind blows
Gonna let it shine 'cause now I know

There is a light at the end of the tunnel
There is a light inside of me
There was a shadow of a doubt
But, baby, it's never going out
There is a light inside of me
There is a light

There is a light, it's so bright
But I've been hiding it
There is a light inside of me

There is a light inside of me, uh-huh
There is a light inside
There is a light

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Hey Em, you know you my favorite white boy, right? (Hahaha)
I owe you for this one
[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on (Yeah)
You can stunt if you want and your ass'll get rolled on (It's 50)
And it feels like my flow's been hot for so long (Yeah)
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong (It's 50)
[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I'm innocent in my head, like a baby born dead
Destination heaven, sit and politic with passengers from 9/11 (Yeah)
The Lord's blessings leave me lyrically inclined (Uh-huh)
Shit, I ain't even got to try to shine (Woo)
God's the seamstress that tailor-fitted my pain
I got scriptures in my brain, I could spit at your dame
Straight out the good book, look, niggas is shook
50 fear no man, warrior, 
swing swords like Conan
Picture me, pen in hand, writin' lines knowin' 
The Source
'll quote it
When I die, they'll read this and say a genius wrote it
I grew up without my pops, should that make me bitter?
I caught cases, I copped out, does that make me a quitter?
In this white man's world, I'm similar to a squirrel
Lookin' for a slut with a nice butt to get a nut
If I get shot today, my phone'll stop ringin' again
These industry niggas ain't friends, they know how to pretend[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on (Yeah)
You can stunt if you want and your ass'll get rolled on (It's 50)
And it feels like my flow's been hot for so long (Yeah)
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong (It's 50)

You can stunt if you want and your ass'll get rolled on (It's 50)
And it feels like my flow's been hot for so long (Yeah)
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong (It's 50)
[Post-Chorus: Eminem]
You've been patiently waitin' to make it through all the hatin'
Debatin' whether or not you can even weather the storm
And as you lay on the table, they operatin' to save you
It's like an angel came to you, sent from the heavens above
[Verse 2: Eminem]
They think they're crazy, but they ain't crazy, let's face it, shit, basically
They're just playin' sick, they ain't shit, they ain't sayin' shit, spray 'em, 50
A to the K, get in the way, I'll bring Dre and them with me
And turn this day into fuckin' mayhem, you stayin' with me?
Don't let me lose you, I'm not tryna confuse you
When I let loose with this Uzi and just shoot through your Isuzu
You get the message? Am I gettin' through to you?
You know what's comin'? You motherfuckers don't even know, do you?
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix 'em up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top, what the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killers tied up in a knot
The juggernauts of this rap shit, like it or not
It's like a fight to the top just to see who'd die for the spot
You put your life in this, nothin' like survivin' a shot
Y'all know what time it is, soon as 50 signs on this dot
Shit, what you know about death threats? 'Cause I get a lot
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building, they meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children (Woo), it's nuclear showers
There's nothin' spookier, you're now about to witness the power of fuckin' 50[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on (Yeah)
You can stunt if you want and your ass'll get rolled on (It's 50)
And it feels like my flow's been hot for so long (Yeah)
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong (It's 50)
[Bridge: 50 Cent]
If the gun squad hearin' all the shots go off
It's 50, they say it's 50
See a nigga laid out with his fuckin' top blown off
It's 50, man, that wasn't 50, don't holla my name
[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
You know you shouldn't throw stones if you live in a glass house (Yeah)
And if you got a glass jaw, you should watch your mouth
'Cause I'll break your face (Uh-huh)
Have your ass runnin', mumblin' to the jake
You goin' against me, dawg, you're makin' a mistake
I'll split ya, leave you lookin' like the Michael Jackson jackets with all them zippers
I'm the boss on this boat, you can call me skipper (Uh-huh)
The way I turn the money over, you should call me flipper (Flipper)
Your bitch a regular bitch, you callin' her wifey
I fucked and feed her fast food, you keepin' her icy
I'm down to sell records, but not my soul
Snoop said this in '94, ""We don't love them hoes""
I got pennies for my thoughts, now I'm rich
See the twenties spinnin' lookin' mean on the 6
Niggas wearin' flags 'cause the colors match they clothes
They get caught in the wrong hood and filled up with holes, motherfucker[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on (Yeah)
You can stunt if you want and your ass'll get rolled on (It's 50)
And it feels like my flow's been hot for so long (Yeah)
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong (It's 50)

Beat me, I move at night when they really can't see me
I ran it back last time but it ain't last time
I got so much around the house, I had to hide mine (Yeah, oh)
[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Throw it all, before I hit the door, she dropped 'em, had the clothes off (Oh)
I thought it was a setup, watch her, I can't doze off
The dogs out the kennel, watchin' with the scope off
With the heat talk, watch it burn your soul off (Ah)
I took 'em out of office, now they work for me now
I took her out the background, she play the lead now (Lead)
Put it in the back gate, or hold the trees down (Trees)
Tryna tell you what I need, somebody do that there
Late at night, at home, get ratchet, can you do that there?
Way out when I'm on road, you send me do that there
Told you I'ma be right back as long as—
Told you I'ma be right back as long as—
Do that there, do that there
Way out when— (Yeah)
Do that there
Late at night, at home, get ratchet, can you do that there? (Can you do it?)

Bling-bling, I get a rush every time I see some diamonds
She get it up, she gon' bounce it like a trampoline
Keep up with swag, she be fresher than a mannequin
All type of bags in her closet like she married to me, married to me
You a puzzle, Patek Phillipe
Keep it right there with my postcode (Slatt, postcode)
I been jumpin' out the gym with no Jordans on (Woah)
She been all above the rim on her torsos (Woah)
Princess cuts, diamonds, I got plenty
Lift it up, air it out, like linen (
Yah
)
Rolls Royce, big ol' truck, I'm in it (
Yah
)
Bouncing 'round like he want smoke, I'm a chimney (
Yah

Tall, her hair long, she Jamaican ('Maican)
And she tryna rage in the bedroom (
Yah
)
And she got a Rollie on her leg too (Leg too)
And it's plain gold, Ace of Spade too (Yeah)
Coco Chanel for reals on her toes
I got white folk money, Eminem with no gold
I got rose gold teeth and rose gold rims on my Rolls
Peep the way they lookin', we gettin' richer than a bookie, ayy[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Beat me, I move at night when they really can't see me
I ran it back last time but it ain't last time
I got so much around the house, I had to hide mine (To hide mine)

Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
[Verse: Travis Scott]
Without goin' deep Shakespeare
Took the squad, brought the play right here (Yeah)
Got the vision and I made that clear (Clear)
Up from two 'til it's two runnin' plays like the Tennessee kid (Tennessee)
I'm the one, that's why they tryna hurt the kid (Kid)
I'm the one, JH, with the braids, with the lights
With the ike and the smoke, but I can't stay away
See this life? Man, I can't stay away
Find a vice, man, I can't stay away
Find it hard, why I can't play it safe?
Seen the top ten pen list, I don't even know how they could pin this
Knowin' that I'm the human Pinterest
Need true love but I know true love's like a friendship
But even Titanic had an endin'
I rock the boat with ice so expensive
Hair long, not no extensions
Money long, shit is extended
She need me now, she need me a pendant
I said you need me now, I ain't finished, huh[Part III]
[Segue: Travis Scott]
I said, you need me now
I said, you need me now
You need me (Ah)
[Verse: Travis Scott]
I stick to the code, binary like I's and O's (Ooh)
I'm too exposed, I gotta keep curtains closed (Closed)
Her body bold, she hid it behind the clothes (Skeet, skeet, skeet)
I'm in Cabo, I'm hittin' these adios
Tryna balance all these up and downs, but I keep poppin' lows
 (Lows)
Man, it is what it is, that's just how it goes
Pure session, I just kept progressin', finally found the flow (Flow)
If the answer's down there with the devil, I may never know
 (Let's go)
My dawg just got freed out the precinct (Free)
Hid it in my bag, let's hit Turks for the weekend (Let's go)
Why did I pop two out that whole pack? Dawg, I'm tweakin' (Geeked)
Baby girl, come suck, keep me up, ain't no sleepin', ooh
She gon' let me beat that body up like we beefin' (Beefin')
Better yet she vegan
 (Vegan), better yet she tweakin' (Tweakin')
Yeah, 6 A.M., I hit my alarm clock (Yeah)
You see the vision, this shit non-stop, gotta keep my palms hot (Hot)
Got Longhorns in my backyard, bitch, I'm a lonestar
The droptop came with the top, I cut the door apart
My brodie keep a stainless to steal, ain't no Chrome Heart
 (Grr)
[Part IV]
[Verse: Travis Scott]
I cut some off, I had to better myself
Against the odds, I'd bet on myself
I was at Frank Gibbins before Thanksgiving, thanks to my health
Too many flaws, tryna generate wealth
Man, that's how you go broke and lose bros and lose hope in this shit
I was thinkin' that we both could be rich, I guess it's one-sided
Crazy how they love to talk shit and got no Trident
I'm loyal, bitch, I got Ye over Biden
I let the shit go off the top, yeah, no typin'
How I go from overlooked to these niggas is overbitin'?

[Intro]
Kick the dust up, c'mon
[Verse 1]
All week long it’s a farmin’ town
They’re makin’ that money grow
Tractors, plows with flashing lights
Backin’ up a two lane road
They take one last lap around
That sun up high goes down
And then it's on, come on
Girl kick it on back
Z71 like a Cadillac
[Chorus]
We go way out where
There ain’t nobody
We turn this cornfield
Into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
Eight up in a four door
Burnin’ up a back road song
Park it and we pile out
Baby, watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up
Back it on up
Fill your cup up
Let’s tear it up, up
And kick the dust up (kick the dust up...)[Verse 2]
Bar downtown they got a line
Of people way out the door
$10 dollar drinks, it’s packed inside
I don’t know what they’re waitin for
Got me a jar full of clear
And I got that music for your ears
And it’s like knock, knock, knock goes the diesel
If you really wanna see the beautiful people
[Chorus]
We go way out where
There ain’t nobody
We turn this cornfield
Into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
Eight up in a four door
Burnin’ up a back road song
Park it and we pile out
Baby, watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up
Let's back it on up
Fill your cup up
Let’s tear it up, up
And kick the dust up (c'mon)[Bridge]
Just follow me down ‘neath the 32 bridge
Y'all be glad you did
 (kick it)
[Chorus 2]
We go way out where
There ain’t nobody
We turn this cornfield
Into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
Eight up in a four door
Burnin’ up a back road song
Park it and we pile out
Baby watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up
Back it on up
Fill your cup up
That’s what’s up, up

[Verse 1]
I've been the needle and the thread
Weaving figure eights and circles round your head
I try to laugh but cry instead
Patiently wait to hear the words you've never said
[Pre-Chorus]
Fumbling through your dresser drawer
Forgot what I was looking for
Try to guide me in the right direction
Making use of all this time
Keeping everything inside
Close my eyes and listen to you crying
[Chorus]
I'm lifting you up
I'm letting you down
I'm dancing 'til dawn
I'm fooling around
I'm not giving up
I'm making your love
This city's made us crazy and we must get out
Oh yeah
[Verse 2]
""This is not goodbye,"" she said
It is just time for me to rest my head
She does not walk, she runs instead
Down these jagged streets and into my bed[Pre-Chorus]
When I was fumbling through your dresser drawer
Forgot what I was looking for
Try to guide me in the right direction
Making use of all this time
Keeping everything inside
Close my eyes and listen to you crying

After all of the things you put me through, oh

I'm not giving up

Way Way Back Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Hey, baby, it's been a minute since
Me and you got caught up in
A little wild and young kinda reckless love
That song that was playing when we first kissed
Yeah, you probably don't think I remember it
Got it in the truck
I can dial it up
[Pre-Chorus]
Every little scratch on that CD
Made it skip along like my heartbeat did back then
Baby, hop in, we can take it
[Chorus]
Way, way back
Find that no-name road
Cross those boxcar tracks
Where we used to go
And lay it way, way, back
Let the moon shine through
Kissing you like yesterday
Like it wasn't all that way, way back
[Verse 2]
Baby, don't try to hide that smile
I can see that memory in your mind
Running all around, we can chase it down
You look even better than you did back then
Girl, close your eyes and we'll be there in no time
And we can rewind it[Chorus]
Way, way, back
Find that no-name road
Cross those boxcar tracks
Where we used to go
And lay it way, way, back
Let the moonshine through
Kissing you like yesterday
Like it wasn't all that way, way back
[Bridge]
Like an old school song
Two of us just hanging on to the night
Wouldn't you like to go there, baby?
[Pre-Chorus]
Every little scratch on that CD
Made it skip along like my heartbeat did back then
Baby, hop in, we can take it

Way, way back
Find that no-name road
Cross those boxcar tracks
Where we used to go
And lay it way, way, back

fake smile Lyrics
On “fake smile,” Ariana discusses her dissatisfaction with life and how she refuses to put up a facade to hide her emotions, as celebrities are often forced to comply with these standards.
[Intro: Wendy Rene]
After laughter comes tears
After laughter comes tears
[Verse 1]
Another night, another party, sayin' hi to everybody
I’m sorry, it's time to leave, I gotta leave now
Got somewhere I gotta be now, I'm starving
Can somebody walk me to my car?
If I go alone, I’m not gon' make it very far
I'm happy for the love and all of the above
If I'm being honest, I done been through way too much
[Pre-Chorus]
I can't fake another smile
I can't fake like I'm alright
Woo, ah (Woo, ah)
And I won't say I’m feeling fine
After what I been through, I can’t lie
Woo, ah (Woo, ah)
[Chorus]
Fuck a fake smile, smile
Fuck a fake smile, fake smile
[Verse 2]
I read the things they write about me
Hear what they're sayin’ on the TV, it's crazy
It's gettin' hard for them to shock me
But every now and then, it’s shocking, don't blame me
I know it's the life that I chose
But baby, I'm grateful, I want you to know
I'm happy for the love and all of the above
If I'm being honest, I done been through way too much[Pre-Chorus]
I can't fake another smile
I can't fake like I'm alright
Woo, ah (Woo, ah)
And I won't say I'm feeling fine
After what I been through, I can't lie
Woo, ah (Woo, ah)

Fuck a fake smile, smile
Fuck a fake smile, fake smile

If I'm hurt, I ain't gon' lie about it
Arms crossed with the attitude, lips pouted
If I'm mad, I ain't gon' lie about it
Neck roll with the attitude, yuh
If I'm hurt, I ain't gon' lie about it
Arms crossed with the attitude, lips pouted
If I'm mad, I ain't gon' lie about it
Neck roll with the attitude, yuh

Silence Between Songs Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You wanna know the demons in my head
But you don't know they're sleepin' in your bed
I pop a pill to try and numb the pain
When it's just me and my brain
I medicate, that's what you made me do
My broken heart, it dreams in baby blue
The music fades and then I think of you
[Chorus]
Oh, I never knew
That the silence between songs (Songs)
Could ever be so lonely and so long
'Til I lost you
[Verse 2]
It's killin' me, I know it's killin' you
The violins are playin' out of tune
I never sleep, just naked in my room

Oh, I never knew
That the silеnce between songs (Songs)
Could evеr be so lonely and so long
'Til I lost you[Bridge]
I can't be alone
With my thoughts
When the music's off
No, I can't turn them down
Tune them out
Don't know how

Oh, I never knew
That the silence between songs (Songs)
Could ever be so lonely and so long

[Intro: Frank Ocean]
Yeah, yeah, oh (Woo)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
That's the way every day goes
Every time we've no control
If the sky is pink and white
If the ground is black and yellow
It's the same way you showed me
Nod my head, don't close my eyes
Halfway on a slow move
It's the same way you showed me
If you could fly, then you'd feel south
Up north's getting cold soon
The way it is, we're on land
So I'm someone to hold true
Keep you cool when it's still alive
Won't let you down when it's all ruin
Just the same way you showed me, showed me
[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
You showed me love
Glory from above
Regard, my dear
It's all downhill from here[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
In the wake of a hurricane
Dark skin of a summer shade
Nosedive in the flood lines
Tall tower of milk crates
It's the same way you showed me
Cannonball off the porch side
Older kids trying off the roof
Just the same way you showed me (You showed)
If you could die and come back to life
Up for air from the swimming pool
You'd kneel down to the dry land
Kiss the earth that birthed you
Gave you tools just to stay alive
And make it out when the sun is ruined
That's the same way you showed me, showed me
[Chorus: Frank Ocean, 
Frank Ocean & 
Beyoncé

You showed me love (
Ah
)
Glory from above
Regard, my dear

Ah

It's all downhill from here

Remember life, remember how it was? (
Ah
)
Climb trees, Michael Jackson, all ends here (
Recalling
)
Say what up to Matthew, to Shoob (
Ooh
)
Say what up to Danny
Say what up to life, immortality (
Ah
, yeah)
Bending up my Nikes
Running out of the Melpomene, nicotine (
Ah
, yeah)
Stealing granny cigs (
Take it easy

Gimme something sweet

Only if you got beef, man, you better holler at me

I shoot the dice, I holler get 'em, girls, daddy need new shoes
Daddy need Pirellis to look mean on 22's (Yeah)
Stash box, Xbox, laptop, fax machine, phone
Bulletproof this bitch and I'm gone
2003 Suburban swerving, too many sips of Henny (Yeah)
The D's sick, they searched the whip and they can't find the semis (Woo)
They was just harassing me 'cause they know who I was
Spent the night in Central Booking for smoking some bud[Chorus]
I don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris'
Tanqueray or Alizé, I don't need shit
Nigga, I'm high all the time (I smoke that good shit)
I stay high all the time (Man, I'm on some hood shit)
Give me some dro, purple haze and some chocolate
Give me a dutch and a lighter, I'll spark shit
And stay high all the time (I smoke that good shit)
I'm high all the time (Man, I'm on some hood shit)
[Bridge]
Now if you heard I done started some shit
It ain't because I be high (I be high, I be high)
And if you heard I done let off a clip
It ain't because I be high (I be high, I be high)
But I twist that lye, lye-lye-lye
[Verse 2]
I get high as I wanna, nigga
Go against me, for sure, you's a goner, nigga
I don't smoke to calm my nerves, but I got beef
Finna crush my enemies like I crush the hashish
If you love me, tell me you love me, don't stare at me, man
I'd hate to be in the pen for clapping one of my fans
Now let me show you how to greet me
When you meet me, when you see me
If you real, my nigga, you know how to holler, ""G-Unit""
There's no competition, it's just me
50 Cent, motherfucker, I'm hot on these streets
If David could go against Goliath with a stone
I could go at Nas and Jigga both for the throne[Chorus]
I don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris'
Tanqueray or Alizé, I don't need shit
Nigga, I'm high all the time (I smoke that good shit)
I stay high all the time (Man, I'm on some hood shit)
Give me some dro, purple haze and some chocolate
Give me a dutch and a lighter, I'll spark shit
And stay high all the time (I smoke that good shit)
I'm high all the time (Man, I'm on some hood shit)
[Verse 3]
Now, who you know besides me who write lines and squeeze nines
And have hoes in the hood sniffing on white lines?
You don't want me to be your kid's role model
I'll teach 'em how to buck them .380s and load up them hollows
Have shorty fresh off the stoop, ready to shoot
Big blunt in his mouth, deuce-deuce in his boot
Sit in the crib sipping Guinness watching Menace, then oh Lord
Have a young nigga bucking shit like he O-Dog (Woo)
My team, they depend on me when it's crunch time
I eat a nigga food in broad day like it's lunchtime
You feeling brave, nigga? 
Go 'head, get gully
See if I won't leave your brains leaking up out your skully
I done made myself hot, so ain't shit you can tell me
Now niggas calling me to feature, man, fuck your money
I ain't hurting, I'm aight, nigga, I'm doing good
I ain't got to write rhymes, I got bricks in the hood[Chorus]
I don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris'
Tanqueray or Alizé, I don't need shit
Nigga, I'm high all the time (I smoke that good shit)
I stay high all the time (Man, I'm on some hood shit)
Give me some dro, purple haze and some chocolate
Give me a dutch and a lighter, I'll spark shit
And stay high all the time (I smoke that good shit)
I'm high all the time (Man, I'm on some hood shit)
[Outro]
G-Unit, are you ready?

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar & 
Lalah Hathaway
]
Everything black, I don't want black (
They want us to bow
)
I want everything black, I ain't need black (
Down to our knees
)
Some white, somethin' black, I ain't mean black (
And pray to the God
)
I hate everything black (
We don't believe
)
Black, I want all things black
I don't need black, I want everything black
I don't need black, our eyes ain't black
I own black, I own everything black
[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Six in the morn'
Fire in the street
Burn, baby, burn (You, you, you, you, you)
That's all I wanna see (You, you, you, you, you)
And sometimes I get off watchin' you die in vain
It's such a shame, they may call me crazy
They may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin'
But homie, you made me (You, you, you, you, you)
Black don't crack, my nigga
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
Been feelin' this way since I was sixteen, came to my senses
You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it
I'm African-American, I'm African, I'm black as the moon
Heritage of a small village
, 
pardon my residence
Came from the bottom of mankind
My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide
You hate me, don't you?
You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture
You're fuckin' evil
I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey
You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
And this is more than confession
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion
I'm guardin' my feelings, I know that you feel it
You sabotage my community, makin' a killin'
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot
[Chorus: Assassin]
I said they treat me like a slave cah me Black
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain cah we Black
And man a say they put me inna chains cah we Black
Imagine now, big gold chains full of rocks
How you no see the whip, left scars 'pon me back
But now we have a big whip parked 'pon the block
All them say we doomed from the start cah we Black
Remember this, every race start from the Black, jus 'member dat
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
I mean, it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society
That's what you're tellin' me, penitentiary would only hire me
Curse me 'til I'm dead, church me with your fake prophesizing
That I'ma be just another slave in my head
Institutionalized manipulation and lies
Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
You hate me, don't you?
I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt
Watchin' me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out
Muscle cars like pull-ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah
Black and successful, this Black man meant to be special
Katzkins on my radar, bitch, how can I help you?
How can I tell you I'm making a killin'?
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot
[Chorus: Assassin]
I said they treat me like a slave cah me Black
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain cah we Black
And man a say they put me inna chains cah we Black
Imagine now, big gold chains full of rocks
How you no see the whip, left scars 'pon me back
But now we have a big whip parked 'pon the block
All them say we doomed from the start cah we Black
Remember this, every race start from the Black, go scream mother
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
When I finish this, if you listen, then sure you will agree
This plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred
It's genocism, it's grimy, little justification
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm Black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan
I'm Black as the name of Tyrone and Darius
, 
excuse my French
But fuck you — no, fuck y'all, that's as blunt as it gets
I know you hate me, don't you?
You hate my people, I can tell 'cause it's threats when I see you
I can tell 'cause your ways deceitful
Know I can tell because you in love with that Desert Eagle
Thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gon' bleed him
It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war
Two tribal armies that wanna build and destroy
Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door
Beefin' with Pirus, only death settle the score
So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers
Or tell Georgia State ""Marcus Garvey got all the answers""
Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day
Or eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays
Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements
Or watch BET 'cause urban support is important
So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street
When gang-banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?
Hypocrite![Instrumental Outro]

It was released on February 9, 2015 as the second single from his third studio album “To Pimp a Butterfly“. The song's hook is performed by Jamaican dancehall artist Assassin, notable for performing on Kanye West's 2013 LP Yeezus, whose lyrics similarly address racial inequality, specifically against African Americans. It shares its title with the novel The Blacker the Berry by American author Wallace Thurman, which deals with similar themes of racism. The album version of the song also features additional vocals from neo soul singer Lalah Hathaway.

“The Blacker the Berry“ is a racially-charged song, noted for being a departure from the ""self-love-promoting"" ""i"", a single released in late 2014. The song features a ""boom-bap beat"", with lyrics that celebrate his African-American heritage, and ""tackles hatred, racism, and hypocrisy head on."" Lamar introduces the themes with lyrics such as; ""Came from the bottom of mankind / My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide / You hate me don’t you / You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture / You’re fucking evil / I want you to recognize that I’m a proud monkey / You vandalize my perception, but can’t take style from me.""

The song, however, contains a deeper meaning of the dangers of hypocrisy. Every verse in the song begins with ""I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015"", followed by Lamar stating issues of racism in society. The final lyric — ""So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street? / When gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me? / Hypocrite! "" — reframes the meaning of the piece, and demonstrates an internal struggle within Lamar and the African-American community about issues of racism and events such as the death of Trayvon Martin. Lamar notes the hypocrisy of black men mourning Martin's death while also themselves committing violent acts against black men, forcing the listener to consider the complexity and perhaps inevitability of the hypocrisy discussed throughout the song. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Kendrick+Lamar/_/The+Blacker+the+Berry"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

When the Stars Come Out Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I was lookin' for a change of scene
You were lookin' at a magazine
It was red carpets and limousines
And the grass seemed so much greener
All we wanted was to get there fast
So we packed up everything we had
Runnin' on hope and a tank of gas
Like dreams ain't just for dreamers
[Pre-Chorus]
We couldn't wait to leave that life behind
And try to find salvation in that city limit sign
[Chorus]
And one of those L.A. nights
When the stars come out
Oh, the stars come out
And shine
And they burn so bright
They drown the downtown lights
When the stars come out
Oh, when the stars come out
[Verse 2]
Everybody's somebody someday
Everybody's got a part to play
Everybody's tryin' to find a way
To say what needs sayin'
Everybody's got a friend of a friend
Somebody that can get you in
Beggin' angels for a sin
In a game that we're all playin'[Pre-Chorus]
You and I, we're gamblers holdin' cards that we can't see
I'm bettin' on you and you're bettin' on me
[Chorus]
One of those L.A. nights
When the stars come out
Oh, the stars come out
And shine
And they burn so bright
They drown the downtown lights
When the stars come out
Oh, when the stars come out

Down on the freeway, the sun is outta sight
And I got a feelin' tonight might be the night
Yeah, tonight might be the night

When the stars come out

[Intro]
(One, two, three, four)
[Verse 1]
You don't ever have to be stronger than you really are
When you're lying in my arms, baby
You don't ever have to go faster than your fastest pace
Or faster than my fastest cars
[Pre-Chorus]
I shouldn't have done it, but I read it in your letter
You said to a friend that you wish you were doing better
I wanted to reach out, but I never said a thing
I shouldn't have done it, but I read it in your letter
You said to a friend that you wish you were doing better
I wanted to call you, but I didn't say a thing
(Two, three, four)
[Chorus]
Oh, I'll pick you up
If you come back to America, just hit me up
'Cause this is crazy love, I'll catch you on the flip side
If you come back to California, you should just hit me up
We'll do whatever you want, travel wherever how far
We'll hit up all the old places
We'll have a party, we'll dance 'til dawn
I'll pick up all of your Vogues and all of your Rolling Stones
Your favorite liquor off the top shelf
I'll throw a party all night long[Verse 2]
You don't ever have to be stronger than you really are
When you're lying in my arms, and, honey
You don't ever have to act cooler than you think you should
You're brighter than the brightest stars
[Pre-Chorus]
You're scared to win, scared to lose
I've heard the war was over if you really choose
The one in and around you
You hate the heat, you got the blues
Changing like the weather, oh, that's so like you
The Santa Ana moves you
(Two, three, four)
[Chorus]
Oh, I'll pick you up
If you come back to America, just hit me up
'Cause this is crazy love, I'll catch you on the flip side
If you come back to California, you should just hit me up
We'll do whatever you want, travel wherever how far
We'll hit up all the old places
We'll have a party, we'll dance 'til dawn

The song appears to be a love song about a person who is struggling and the singer offering them comfort and support. The first verse implies that the singer is there to offer emotional support, and the listener doesn't need to be stronger than they really are when they are in the singer's arms.

In the pre-chorus, the singer mentions that they read a letter that the person wrote to a friend saying they wish they were doing better. The singer admits that they wanted to reach out and offer help but didn't say anything. The chorus is a promise that if the person comes back to California, the singer will be there for them, do whatever they want, and throw a party all night long.

The second verse suggests that the person is afraid to win or lose and that they're changing like the weather, but the Santa Ana wind from California moves them. The chorus repeats the same sentiment as before, with the singer reassuring the person that they will be there for them.

It is the ninth track from Lana Del Rey's sixth studio album, Norman Fucking Rockwell!

Ain't no need to remind ya, it's AG in your face (Face)

If you're gon' keep speakin' my love language
You can talk your shit all night

I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lyin' on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now
[Chorus]
Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
[Verse 2]
Flash forward and we're takin' on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes[Pre-Chorus]
But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about
[Chorus]
Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh
[Bridge]
And I remember that fight, 2:30AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said, ""I'll never leave you alone""[Chorus]
You said, ""I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine""
[Post-Chorus]
Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back
(Hold on) You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter (Make it last)
(Hold on) You are the best thing that's ever been mine (Hold on)
[Outro]
Yes, yes, do you believe it? (Hold on)
Yes, yes, we're gonna make it now (Hold on)

[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & 
Kanye West
]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Yeah, this the real one, baby
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Uh, Chi-Town, stand up!
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Southside, Southside
We gon' set this party off right
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Westside, Westside
We gon' set this party off right
Oh, when it all
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Man, I promise, she's so self-conscious
She has no idea what she doin' in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents'll look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurr
The concept of school seems so securr
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a carurr
She like, ""Fuck it, I'll just stay down hurr and do hair""
'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs
Of new Airs, 'cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve
And she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail, and well[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & 
Kanye West
]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
C'mon, c'mon, and when it all falls down
Oh, when it all
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Man, I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pashas done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that Ver-say-see!
Then I spent four hundred bucks on this
Just to be like, ""Nigga, you ain't up on this""
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some 1s that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seem we livin' the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
We tryna buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we'll stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe
[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & 
Kanye West
]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, come on
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, come on
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
And when it all falls down[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I say, ""Fuck the police,"" that's how I treat 'em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
'Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorty's hollerin', ""Where the ballers at?""
Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack
And the white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gon' act holier than thou'
'Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou'
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
‘Cause I wanna be on 
106 & Park
, pushin' a Benz
I want to act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past-due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spendin' before I get it
We all self-conscious, I'm just the first to admit it
[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & 
Kanye West
]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
C'mon, c'mon
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
C'mon, c'mon, and when it falls down
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Southside, Southside
We gon' set this party off right
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Westside, Westside
We gon' set this party off right
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Chi-Town, Chi-Town
We gon' show 'em how we get down
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Now, Syleena, you just like a safe belt, you saved my life
C'mon
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down[Outro: DeRay]

I can't keep workin' like this

Need you to remind me where I come from
Can you remind me of my gravity?
Ground me when I'm tumblin', spiralin', plummetin' down to Earth
You keep me down to Earth
Call me on my bullshit

Boy, we're back and forth
I need your support now (Now, now, now, now, now)
In case you call my phone one more 'gain
Got no panties on
I need your support now (Now, now, now, now, now)
I know you'd rather be laid up with a big booty
Probably hella positive 'cause she got a big booty (Wow)
I know I'd rather be paid up
You know I'm sensitive 'bout havin' no booty
Havin' nobody, only you, buddy
Can you hold me when nobody's around us?

'Cause I, I feel the same way
If you don't like me, you don't have to fool with me

I fall, I get up
I fall, but I get up
I stand tall, I stand tall

Ridin' parasail, rollin' through the grass
Shaded under trees
Lookin' through a glass

You is all I need
Water movin' fast, washin' memories, tryna make it last

Flyin' through the bush, we flyin' through the bush
Wave, we gon' rock, wave, we gon' take a swole
We gon' swole, we gon' rock clean
We gon' shake off the mother-mother-mother-mother live
We gon' live, we gon' rock show
We gon' pop, we gon' rock, I

Ski Mask Way Lyrics
Also the title of a book someone ghostwrote for 50 on his G-Unit Books imprint, “Ski Mask Way” is the story of a robbing spree that starts in NY and ends in VA
[Intro]
Yeah
I'm tryna catch me something
A little jux or something
[Chorus]
Nigga, that watch is nice, that's what you bought for me?
That chain is nice, that's what you bought for me?
Them earrings is nice, that's what you bought for me?
Take that shit off, 
move, I'll break you off properly
I get mine the fast way, ski mask way
Make money, make money-money-money
Nigga, if you ask me, this the only way
Take money, take money-money-money
[Verse 1]
You wanna spray at me? Go 'head; the last nigga that tried
Got hit, keeled over, and bled 'til he died
Your little sister calling you stupid, reason why?
Her and your mama in the living room now hog-tied
I came up with two new ways to get rich, I can't wait
Got a brand-new SIG and that old .38
I be scheming to put a little bread on my plate
Watching dreads serve skunk through a hole in the gate
I stick a nigga for his shine, sell him back the next day
You thought I really wanted your pussy? Bitch, please
This the stash house, jackpot, there go them keys
My black G-Unit hoodie just reek of marijuana
Cocaine coming out my pores in the sauna
I'm serious, man, I'm so sincere
This the flow right here that fucked up Jeffrey's career
Make money, take money, yeah, nigga, YEAH![Chorus]
Nigga, that watch is nice, that's what you bought for me?
That chain is nice, that's what you bought for me?
Them earrings is nice, that's what you bought for me?
Take that shit off, 
move, I'll break you off properly
I get mine the fast way, ski mask way
Make money, make money-money-money
Nigga, if you ask me, this the only way
Take money, take money-money-money
[Verse 2]
Who's that peeping in my window?
Wow—the Feds on me now
They know when I'm sleeping, they know when I'm wake
I know they got my phone tapped, I'm screaming, ""Fuck Jake!""
I'm tryna stay out them pens, so I switched states
Bad news,
 VA, now, that sounds great
I see niggas with that ice on, rims shined up
This town's one big pussy, waiting to get fucked
I holla at A.I. peoples to get gats
They charge me 500 apiece for two MACs
Then I'm back doing me, I'm back out on a spree
Catch me a nigga slipping out, pumping that D
Get me a little crew, I'll have 'em pumping for me
The more product I take, the more paper we see
Change my name in NY, they don't know where I be
Yeah, a nigga doing dirt, but a nigga low-key[Chorus]
Nigga, that watch is nice, that's what you bought for me?
That chain is nice, that's what you bought for me?
Them earrings is nice, that's what you bought for me?
Take that shit off,

Watch the sunrise
Say your goodbyes, off we go
Some conversation
No contemplation, hit the road

On the side of the highway, baby
Our road is long, your hold is strong

Don't think I know how to go slow
Oh, where you at now?
I feel around, there you are

Cool these engines, calm these jets
I ask you, ""How hot can it get?""
And as you wipe off beads of sweat
Slowly, you say, ""I'm not there yet""[Chorus]

But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret

Death Row Lyrics
Death Row is the last song on Stapleton’s From A Room: Volume 1.

The song gives an insight to the thoughts from a prisoner in the death row of a prison, after receiving the death penalty.

Well up here's the window sitting way up high
I can't look up enough to see the sky
There ain't no good light here below
Death Row

Don't want no preacher man to come around
I don't need him to lay my burden down
Already told Jesus everything I know

Death Row

When it's time for my last request
Tell my mama that I did my best
Tell my baby that I love her so

Got a calendar up on my wall
Marking days till I get the call
Till it's time for me to go

Up to No Good Livin’ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Wish I could come home from workin'
And not have her checking  my breath
I'm tired of her turning her questions
Into the Gettysburg Address
There's no reason why she shouldn't trust me
The fact that she don't makes me mad
Can't count all the times that I've begged her
Honey, just let my past be the past
[Chorus]
I used to drink like a fish and run like a dog
Done a whole lotta shit not permitted by law
People called me the Picasso of painting the town
I've finally grown up
I've finally changed and that someone I was
Is somebody I ain't
But she finds it hard to believe that she's turned me around
So I'll probably die before I live all my
Up to no good livin' down
[Verse 2]
Gave up on bringing her flowers
That just kept making things worse
I ain't been guilty of nothing
But being the man she deserves[Chorus]
I used to drink like a fish and run like a dog
Done a whole lotta shit not permitted by law
People called me the Picasso of painting the town
I've finally grown up
I've finally changed and that someone I was
Is somebody I ain't
But she finds it hard to believe that she's turned me around
So I'll probably die before I live all my
Up to no good livin' down
I used to cuss like a sailor and howl at the moon
And I woke up some mornings with I-don't-know-who
But I never dreamed back then I'd have to pay for it now
You know, I'll probably die before I live all my

[Verse 1]
Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
Welcome to the final show
I hope you're wearing your best clothes
You can't bribe the door on your way to the sky
You look pretty good down here
But you ain't really good
[Pre-Chorus]
If we never learn we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets, the bullet?
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
Your bullets, a bullet?
[Chorus]
Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get away from here
Just stop your crying, it'll be alright
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from here
[Verse 2]
Just stop your crying, have the time of your life
Breaking through the atmosphere
Things look pretty good from here
Remember everything will be alright
We can meet again somewhere
Somewhere far away from here[Pre-Chorus]
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets, the bullets?
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets, the bullets?
[Chorus]
Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get away from here
Stop your crying, baby, it'll be alright
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from here
[Pre-Chorus]
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
Your bullets, the bullets?
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
Your bullets, your bullets?
[Bridge]
We don't talk enough
We should open up
Before it's all too much
Will we ever learn?
We've been here before
It's just what we know[Outro]
Stop your crying, baby, it's a sign of the times
We gotta get away
We got to get away, we got to get away
We got to get away, we got to get away
We got to, we got to run
We got to, we got to run

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I need some water
Something came over me
Way too hot to simmer down, might as well overheat
Too close to comfort
As blood rush my favorite vein
Heartbeat racing like a junkie's
I just need you to want me
Am I asking too much?
Let me put the head in
Ooh, I don't want more than that; girl, I respect the cat
I promise, just a touch
Let me put the head in
If it's okay; she said, ""It's okay""
[Interlude: Kendrick Lamar & 
R
AT BOY
]
Yeah, I need everybody's motherfuckin' hands up right now
I need everybody's motherfuckin'—
Door and his Nike Air Rattles
Rush the fire exit, no time for battles
Well I, I never expected
This that new shit
This that new, new shit
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Wake up in the mornin', thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy, take a shit, then roll some weed up
Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch
Don't go to work today, cop you a fit
Or maybe some kicks and make you—[Interlude: 
RAT BOY

Door and his Nike Air Rattles
Rush the fire exit, no time for battles
Well I, I never expected
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Wake up in the morning, thinking 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy—hol' up
Wake up in the mornin', thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy, take a shit, then roll some weed up
Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch, don't go to work today
Cop you a fit or maybe some kicks and make it work today
Hang with the homies, stunt on your baby mama
Sip some lean, go get a pistol, shoot out the window
Bet your favorite team, play you some Madden
Go to the club or your mama house
Whatever you doing, just make it count
 
(I need some water)
Wake up in the morning, thinking 'bout money, kick your feet up
Hop in the shower, put on your makeup, lace your weave up
Touch on yourself, call up your nigga, tell him he ain't shit
Credit card scam, get you a Visa, make it pay your rent
Hop on the 'Gram, flex on the bitches that be hatin' on you
Pop you a pill, call up your bitches, have 'em waitin' on you
Go to the club, have you some fun, make that ass bounce
It's whatever, just make it count[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]

Too close to comfort

Ooh, I don't want more than that; girl, I respect the cat
I promise, just a touch
Let me put the head in
If it's okay; she said, ""It's okay""
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I wake in the morning, my head spinning from the last night
Both in a trance, feelings are dead—what a fast life
Manager called, the lobby call is 11:30
Did this before, promised myself I'd be a hour early
Room full of clothes, bag full of money: call it loose change
Fumbled my jewelry, 100K, I lost a new chain
Hop on the bird, hit the next city for another M
Take me a nap, then do it again
We all woke up, tryna tune to the daily news
Looking for confirmation, hoping election wasn't true
All of us worried, all of us buried, in our feelings deep
None of us married to his proposal, make us feel cheap
Stale and sad, distraught and mad, tell the neighbor 'bout it—
Bet they agree, parade the streets with your voice proudly
Time passing, things change
Reverting back to our daily programs, stuck in our ways
Lust[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Lately, I feel like I been lusting over the fame
Lately, we lust on the same routine of shame
Lately (Lately) Lately, my lust been heightened (Lately)
Lately, it's all contradiction (Lately, I'm not here)
Lately, I lust over self (Lust turn into fear)
Lately, in James 4:4 says
""Friend of the world is enemy of the Lord""
Brace yourself: Lust is all yours
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I need some water
Something came over me
Way too hot to simmer down, might as well overheat
Too close to comfort

That's the kind of car you wanna drive when you're sixteen
Fast
That's the kind of boys that you want on your home team

Yeah, you think you're gonna catch your big dreams just like that
Fast
And here you are, looking back

Sixty seconds now feels more like thirty
Tick-tock, won't stop, around it goes
Sand through the glass sure falls in a hurry
All you keep trying to do is slow it down, soak it in
You're trying to make the good times last as long as you can
But you can't, man
It just goes too fast
[Verse 2]
Fast
That's what your parents said when we were falling in love
It's too fast
There ain't no way the two of us were ever going to last
But we did, and here we are, and our only problem is[Chorus]
Sixty seconds now feels more like thirty

You're trying to make the good times last as long as you can
But you can't, man
It just goes too fast
[Bridge]
Looking at you looking out the window right now
Those eyes, that dress, that smile, that laugh
If I could hit pause, I would somehow
But it don't work like that
[Chorus]
Sixty seconds now feels more like thirty
Tick-tock, won't stop, around it goes
Sand through the glass sure falls in a hurry

Kanye West - Get Em High ft. Common & Talib Kweli (Traduzione Italiana)
Русский
Get Em High Lyrics
A crowd-pleaser and smoking anthem, Kanye, Talib, and Common take turns flexing their skills.
[Intro: Kanye West]
Uh-uh, I'm tryna catch the beat
Uh, I'm tryna catch the beat
I'm tryna catch the beat, uh-uh, uh-uh
I'm tryna catch the beat
[Chorus: Kanye West]
N-now, th-th-throw your motherfuckin' hands
Get 'em high
All the girls pass the weed to your motherfuckin' man
Get 'em high
Now I ain't never tell you to put down your hands
Keep 'em high
And if you're losin' your high, then smoke again
Keep 'em high
 (Now, now, now, now)
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My flow is in the pocket like wallets, I got the bounce like hydraulics
I can't call it, I got the swerve like alcoholics
My freshman year, I was going through hella problems
'Til I built up the nerve to drop my ass up out of college
My teacher said I's a loser, I told her, ""Why don't you kill me?
I give a fuck if you fail me, I'm gonna follow
My heart"", and if you follow the charts
Or the plaques or the stacks, you ain't gotta guess who's back, you see?
I'm so Chi' that you thought I was bashful
But this bastard's flow will bash your skull
And I will cut your girl like Pastor Tro'
And I don't usually smoke, but pass the 'dro
And I won't give you that money that you askin' for
Why you think me and Dame cool? We assholes
That's why we hear your music and fast forward
'Cause we don't wanna hear that weak shit no mo'[Chorus: Kanye West]
N-now, th-th-throw your motherfuckin' hands
Get 'em high
All the girls pass the weed to your motherfuckin' man
Get 'em high
Now I ain't never tell you to put down your hands
Keep 'em high
And if you're losin' your high, then smoke again
Keep 'em high (Now, now, now, now, now, 
You've got mail
)
[Verse 2: Kanye West, 
Sumeke Rainey
 & 
Talib Kweli
]
Now who the hell is this
Emailing me at 11:26
Telling me that she thirty-six, twenty-six plus double-d?
You know how girls on Black Planet be when they get bubbly
At NYU but she hail from Kansas
Right now, she 
just lampin'
, chillin' on campus
Sent me a picture with her feelin' on Candice
Who said her favorite rapper was the late great Francis
W-H-I-T,
 
it's getting late, mami
Your screen saver say Tweet, so you got to call me
And bring a friend for my friend, his name Kweli
You mean Talib? Lyrics stick to your rib
 (I mean)
That's my favorite CD that I play at my crib
 (I mean)
You don't really know him, why is you lyin'?
Yo, Kwe, she don't believe me, please pick up the line
She gon' think that I'm lyin', just spit a couple of lines
Then maybe I'll be able to give her dick all the time
And get her high (
Yeah
), ow[Verse 3: Talib Kweli & 
Common
]
I can't believe this nigga use my name for pickin' up dimes
But never mind
, 
I need some tracks, you tryin' to pull tracks out
And my rhymes is finna blow, you trying to blow backs out
Well, okay, you twisted my arm, I'll assist with the charm
Ayo, ain't you meet that chick at that conference with your moms?
Her sister the bomb, but she got the bougie behavior
Always got something to say like a OkayPlayer-hater
Anyways, I don't usually fuck with the Internet
Or chicks with birth control stuck to they arm like Nicorette
You really fuckin' that much or tryna get off cigarettes? (
Keep 'em high
)
If she think it's fly, she ain't met a real nigga yet (No)
I apologize if I come off a little inconsiderate
I got the Bubba Kush and her sister could get a hit of it, yeah
 (
Yo, yo
)
[Verse 4: Common]
Get 'em high like noon or the moon
Or a room filled with smoke, a hype filled with dope
Y'all assumed I was doomed, out of tune
But I still filled the notes with real nigga quotes
Real rappers is hard to find like a remote
Control, rap is out of
Used to, but still got love
That's why I abuse you who are not thugs
Rock clubs like Tiger Woods in the hood
Should have my own reality show called ""Soul Survivor""
I stole on live-er niggas than you
You's a bitch, I got ones that are thicker than you
How could I ever let your words affect me?
They say hip-hop is dead, I'm here to resurrect me
Marks is too sexy to even make songs like these
That's why the raw don't know your name, like Alicia Keys
Too many featured MCs, and producers is popular
Twelve thousand spins, nobody got to coppin' a
Album, 
how come you the hot garbage of
The year? It's clear your image is looped up
Label got you souped up, tellin' you you sick
When you a dick with a loose nut
Video hard to watch like Medusa
Even your club record need a booster
, chimped up
With a pimp cup, illiterate nigga,
 read the 
infra-
Red across your head
, 
I'm bred king like Simba
Bolder than Denver,
 
I ain't a mad rapper
Just a MC with a temper
You dancin' for money like Honey
, 
I did this my way
So when the industry crash, I survive like Kanye
Spittin' through wires and fires, MCs retirin'
Got your hands up, get them motherfuckers higher, then[Chorus: Kanye West & 
Common
]
N-now, th-th-throw your motherfuckin' hands
Get 'em high (
Yeah
)
All the girls pass the weed to your motherfuckin' man
Get 'em high (
Mm-mm, uh-uh, uh
)
Now I ain't never tell you to put down your hands
Keep 'em high (
Keep 'em high, keep 'em high, uh-uh

This McCartney-led number, a cover of the 1961 film of the same name’s theme song.

It was performed at their Royal Variety Performance of 1963.
[Intro]
A taste of honey!
Tasting much sweeter than wine
[Verse 1]
I dream of your first kiss, and then
I feel upon my lips again
[Chorus]
A taste of honey (A taste of honey)
Tasting much sweeter than wine
[Bridge]
Oh, I will return, yes, I will return
I'll come back for the honey and you
[Verse 2]
Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart
There lingers still, though we're far apart
[Chorus]

Tasting much sweeter than wine

Skies are crying, I am watching
Catching tear drops in my hands
Only silence as it's ending
Like we never had a chance
Do you have to make me feel like
There's nothing left of me?

You can take everything I have
You can break everything I am
Like I'm made of glass
Like I'm made of paper
Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
Like a skyscraper

As the smoke clears, I awaken
And untangle you from me
Would it make you feel better
To watch me while I bleed?
All my windows still are broken
But I'm standing on my feet[Chorus]

You can break everything I am
Like I'm made of glass
Like I'm made of paper

I will be rising from the ground

Go run, run, run, I'm gonna stay right here (Here)
Watch you disappear (-Pear), yeah, oh
Go run, run, run, yeah, it's a long way down (Down)
But I am closer to the clouds up here

You can take everything I have (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
You can break everything I am (Ah, ah, ah, ah)

[Verse 1]
And it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know it's all the same, another time and place
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through
[Chorus]
Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh
[Verse 2]
So we've been outnumbered, raided, and now, cornered
It's hard to fight when the fight ain’t fair
We're getting stronger now, find things they never found
They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared
You can walk away, say we don't need this
But there's something in your eyes says we can beat this
[Chorus]
'Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh[Bridge]
Tonight, we stand, get off our knees
Fight for what we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
But we'll stand up champions tonight
[Chorus]
It was the night things changed
Can you see it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
It's a revolution, throw your hands up
'Cause we never gave in
And we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah
Hallelujah",https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-change-lyrics,"",""

The second that you turn your back, she'll be outta sight
Baby, she'll break your heart
The second that you spend the night apart-art

Oh, how could you walk away, from everything we made?
How could you do it?
Oh, you better watch yourself, I think that girl's insane

As soon as she smells your blood in the water
You better run to survive
Before she makes you her latest slaughter[Pre-Chorus]
How could you do it?
Oh, just come back to me
Baby, I'm begging, please
How could you do it?
Oh, she knows I love you still, you're just her latest kill

""I was like, that would be a really fun album title, but then as the song started being made I kind of just set on “Music for a Sushi Restaurant.”""

""After Fine Line, I had an idea of how I thought the next album would open.

Kelly caught that outbound bus for Vegas
And we're all out here talking trash, making bets
Lips wrapped 'round our cigarettes
She always thought she was too good to be a waitress

And Brenda's traded smokes for cake

And tell them both it'll be okay

[Instrumental intro]
[Verse 1]
Well, we all have a face
That we hide away forever
And we take them out and show ourselves
When everyone has gone
Some are satin, some are steel
Some are silk and some are leather
They're the faces of a stranger
But we'd love to try them on
[Chorus]
Well, we all fall in love
But we disregard the danger
Though we share so many secrets
There are some we never tell
Why were you so surprised
That you never saw the stranger?
Did you ever let your lover
See the stranger in yourself?
[Post Chorus]
Don't be afraid to try again
Everyone goes south every now and then
You've done it
Why can't someone else?
You should know by now
You've been there yourself[Verse 2]
Once I used to believe
I was such a great romancer
Then I came home to a woman
That I could not recognize
When I pressed her for a reason
She refused to even answer
It was then I felt the stranger
Kick me right between the eyes
[Chorus]
Well, we all fall in love
But we disregard the danger
Though we share so many secrets
There are some we never tell
Why were you so surprised
That you never saw the stranger?
Did you ever let your lover
See the stranger in yourself?
[Post Chorus]
Don't be afraid to try again
Everyone goes south every now and then
You've done it
Why can't someone else?
You should know by now
You've been there yourself[Verse 3]
You may never understand
How the stranger is inspired
But he isn't always evil
And he is not always wrong
Though you drown in good intentions
You will never quench the fire
You'll give in to your desire
When the stranger comes along
Ooo ooo
Ooh ooh

the catwalk assassin (
Come on

When they know it's slappin', then here come the yappin'
All of this snitchin', and all of this bitchin'

Extra leg, but I ain't even tryna kick it

All the same to me,
 
Plain Jane

spaghetti
No sauce, no sauce (
No

They salty, they shootin', like Curry (
One, two, three

One hand on my holster, then pass it to Hova
Thought it was sweet when they was walkin'
In the backdoor of the kitchen past the dirty dishes
Now we on a mission, tried to turn me to the opposition
I'm appalled 'bout the proposition
Y'all been played by the plagiaristic, ain't gon' give no clout addiction my attention
I ain't no regular singer, now come get everythin' you came for[Chorus: Beyoncé]
I ain't in no gang, but I got shooters and I bang-bang

Knockin’ Boots Lyrics
[Verse 1]
This truck needs a half tank
These wheels need a two-lane
This radio needs three songs to play
To get me 'cross town to you
That dress needs to slip off
That hair needs to come down
Friday nights need to do
What Friday nights need to do
That's the truth
[Chorus]
Yeah, birds need bees and ice needs whiskey
Boys like me need girls like you to kiss me
""Fishin' in the Dark"" needs Nitty Gritty
Under that pale moon
Sweet tea needs that sugar stirrin'
Small town nights need both ends burnin'
Shades need drawin', hearts need fallin'
Boots need knockin', knockin' boots
Knockin' boots, me and you, oh
[Verse 2]
Long weeks need a weekend
Cheap drinks need a-slingin'
That dance floor needs some me on you
And you on me tonight
Singalongs need to be sung
Tip bells need to be rung
Last calls need a call that cab
And backseats need I want you so bad[Chorus]
Yeah, birds need bees and ice needs whiskey
Boys like me need the girls like you to kiss me
""Fishin' in the Dark"" needs Nitty Gritty
Under that pale moon
Sweet tea needs that sugar stirrin'
Small town nights need both ends burnin'
Shades need drawin', hearts need fallin'
Boots need knockin', knockin' boots
Knockin' boots, girl, me and you
[Bridge]
Doors need shuttin'
Lights need cuttin'
Lips need lockin'
Boots need knockin'
[Chorus]
And birds need bees and ice needs whiskey
Boys like me need girls like you to kiss me
""Fishin' in the Dark"" needs Nitty Gritty
Under that pale moon
Sweet tea needs that sugar stirrin'
Small town nights need both ends burnin'
Shades need drawin', hearts need fallin'
Boots need knockin', knockin' boots
Mmm, knockin' boots, me and you, oh

What Now Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I've been ignoring this big lump in my throat
I shouldn't be crying
Tears were for the weaker days
I'm stronger now, or so I say
But something's missing
[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream
[Chorus]
What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (Wait it out)
What now? Oh-oh-oh-oh
What now?
[Verse 2]
I found the one
He changed my life
But was it me that changed
And he just happened to come at the right time
I'm supposed to be in love, but I'm numb again[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just sitting there laughing at me
And I just wanna scream
[Chorus]
What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (Wait it out)
What now? (Please tell me)
What now?
[Bridge]
There's no one to call, 'cause I'm just playing games with them all
But the more I swear I'm happy, the more that I'm feeling alone
'Cause I spend every hour just going through the motions
I can't even get the emotions to come out
Dry as a bone, but I just wanna shout
[Chorus]
What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (Wait it out)
What now? (Somebody tell me)
What now?[Outro]
I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know, oh-oh, why
I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know, oh-oh, why
I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know, oh-oh, why

It received generally positive reviews, with many critics calling it an emotional, stand-out song on the album and praised Rihanna's vocals. Following the release of Unapologetic, ""What Now"" made chart appearances on the French Singles Chart and UK Singles Chart, as well as the UK R&B Chart where it peaked at number 32. The single also peaked at number 25 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and at number 27 on the Canadian Hot 100 charts. To promote the song, Rihanna performed on Alan Carr: Chatty Man and the song is included on the set list of her Diamonds World Tour (2013).[6] Jeff Nicholas, Jonathan Craven, and Darren Craig from Uprising Creativity directed the song's music video, which portrays Rihanna having an ""emotional breakdown"" and performing exorcism-type dance moves.

They are known to be really lusty, sensual, have high libido and are considered best in bed when they’re with someone they love, trust and have some sort of connection with. Even though Virgos are considered patient lovers, Bey’s expressing the tension she feels as she can’t wait no more. She and her lover don’t have time like they used to, so she’s calling him to come, as her excitement is getting bigger and taking over her.

This is the second time Beyoncé is mentioning Virgo in her music, previously done on her debut album Dangerously in Love with track 14 called “Gift from Virgo.” <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Beyonc%C3%A9/_/vIrgO%27s+grOOve"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Rosalinda’s Eyes Lyrics
This song was written by Joel as a hypothetical message to his mother Rosalind by his father Howard (who left the family for Cuba, and eventually Vienna).

It is a very Latin-inspired song with a pan flute…

[Verse 1]
I play nights in the Spanish part of town
I've got music in my hands
The work is hard to find, but that don't get me down
Rosalinda understands
[Hook 1]
Crazy Latin dancing solo down in 
Herald Square
Oh, Havana, I've been searching for you everywhere
And though I'll never be there
I know what I would see there
I can always find my Cuban skies
In 
Rosalinda's eyes
[Verse 2]
When she smiles she gives everything to me
And when she's all alone, she cries
I'd do anything to take away her tears
Because they're Rosalinda's eyes
[Hook 2]
Señorita don't be lonely, I will soon be there
Oh, Havana, I've been searching for you everywhere
And I've got a chance to make it
It's time for me to take it
I'll return before the fire dies
In Rosalinda's eyes[Flute Solo]
[Verse 3]
All alone in a Puerto Rican band
Union wages, wedding clothes
Hardly anyone has seen how good I am
But Rosalinda says she knows
[Hook 1]
Crazy Latin dancing solo down in 
Herald Square
Oh, Havana, I've been searching for you everywhere
And though I'll never be there
I know what I would see there
I can always find my Cuban skies
In Rosalinda's eyes

You are to me
A part of me just like anatomy
You're pulling me
You're pulling me in like you're gravity

I'm notorious for thinking you're full of beautiful
Instead of hollow
Sugar on your lips, it starts to kill
Jagged like a pill, so hard to swallow

Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
I'm trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth

If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy
In love with you, am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
You give to me
Everything, anything that I could dream
And at least that's what it seems
Could it be I don't know what's good for me?[Refrain: Justin Bieber]

Instead of hollow
Sugar on your lips, it starts to kill

Or am I in love with the feeling?

Between heaven and disaster
Sorry if I make you feel like
I'm standing on the borderline

Hah, yeah
Hell yeah
Hah, know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah
[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Mister Busta, where the fuck you at?
Can't scrap a lick, so I know you got your gat
Your dick on hard from fuckin' your road dogs
The hoods you threw up with, niggas you grew up with
Don't even respect your ass
That's why it's time for the doctor to check your ass, nigga
Used to be my homie, used to be my ace
Now I wanna 
slap the taste out your mouth
Make you bow down to the Row
Fuckin' me, now I'm fuckin' you, lil' ho
Oh, don't think I forgot, let you slide
Let me ride, just another homicide
Yeah, it's me so I'ma talk on
Stompin' on the easiest streets that you can walk on
So strap on your Compton hat, your locs
And watch your back 'cause you might get smoked, loc
And pass the bud and stay low-key
B.G., 'cause you lost all your homie's love
Now call it what you want to
You fucked with me, now it's a must that I fuck with you[Interlude: Dr. Dre]
You better raise up
Yeah, that's what the fuck I'm talkin' about
We have your motherfuckin' 
record company surrounded
Put down the candy and let the little boy go
You know what I'm sayin'? Punk motherfucker (
We want Eazy
)
(
We want Eazy, we want Eazy
)
[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg, 
Snoop Dogg & Dr. Dre

Bow-wow-wow, yippy-yo, yippy-yay
Doggy Dogg's in the motherfuckin' house
Bow-wow-wow, yippy-yo, yippy-yay
Death Row's in the motherfuckin' house
Bow-wow-wow, yippy-yo, yippy-yay
The sounds of a dog brings me to another day
Play with my bone, would you, Timmy?
It seems like you're good for makin' jokes about your jimmy
Well, here's a jimmy joke about your mama that you might not like
I heard she was a 'Frisco dyke
But fuck your mama, I'm talkin' about you and me
Toe to toe, Tim M-U-T
Your bark was loud but your bite wasn't vicious
And them rhymes you were kickin' were quite bootylicious
You get with Doggy Dogg? ""Oh, is he crazy?""
With your mama and your daddy hollerin', ""Baby""
So won't they let you know
That if you fuck with Dre, nigga, you're fuckin' wit Death Row
And I ain't even swangin' them thangs
I'm hollerin' 187 with my dick in your mouth, biatch[Interlude: RBX]
Yeah, nigga, Compton and Long Beach together on this motherfucker
So you wanna pop that shit, get your motherfuckin' cranium cracked, nigga, step on up
Now, we ain't no motherfuckin' joke, so remember the name
Mighty, mighty D-R
Yeah, motherfucker (
The shit done hit the fan
)
[Verse 3: Dr. Dre & 
Snoop Dogg
]
Now understand this, my nigga Dre can't be touched
Luke's bending over 
so Luke's gettin' fucked, buster
Must've thought I was sleazy
Or thought I was a mark 'cause I used to hang with Eazy
Animosity
 made you speak what you spoke
 (Yeah)
Ayo, Dre
 (What up?),
 
chip this nigga off, loc
If it ain't another ho that I gots to fuck with
Gap teeth in your mouth, so my dick's gots to fit
With my nuts on your tonsils
While you're on stage rappin' at your wack-ass concert
And I'ma snatch your ass from the backside
And show you how Death Row pull off that who-ride
Now you might not 
understand
 me
'Cause I'ma rob you in Compton and blast you in Miami
Then we gon' creep to South Central
On a street knowledge mission
 as I steps in the temple
Spot him, got him, as I pulls out my strap
Got my chrome to the side of his 
White Sox hat
You tryna check my homie, you best check yourself
'
Cause when you diss Dre you diss yourself
, motherfucker (
Yeah, nigga
)[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
So I don't want no dilapidated, two-faced, pigeon-toed, bow-legged, cross-eyed son of a gun fuckin' with me
Yeah, nine-deuce
Dr. Dre droppin' chronic once again
It don't stop
Punishin' punk motherfuckers real quick-like
Compton style, nigga
Doggy Dogg's in the motherfuckin' house
Yeah, Long Beach is in the motherfuckin' house
Yeah, yeah, straight up (Death Row is in the house, yeah)
Really, though
Breaking all them suckas off something real proper-like
You know what I'm sayin'?
All them sucker-ass niggas can eat a fat dick
Yeah, Eazy-E, Eazy-E, Eazy-E can eat a big fat dick
Tim Dog can eat a big fat dick
Luke can eat a fat dick

The song was released as a single in 1993.

The single failed to match the popularity of Dre's earlier hit, ""Nuthin' but a ""G"" Thang"", although it did reach number eight on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart in June 1993 and number six (counting the twelve weeks spent) on the rap/hip-hop chart on that year's overall ranking. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Dr.+Dre/_/Fuck+Wit+Dre+Day+(And+Everybody%27s+Celebratin%27)"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","""Fuck wit Dre Day (And Everybody's Celebratin')"" (released as ""Dre Day"") is a hip-hop single by Dr. Dre, with a guest appearance by Snoop Doggy Dogg, from the 1992 album The Chronic on Death Row Records. The song was released as a single in 1993.

The single failed to match the popularity of Dre's earlier hit, ""Nuthin' but a ""G"" Thang"", although it did reach number eight on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart in June 1993 and number six (counting the twelve weeks spent) on the rap/hip-hop chart on that year's overall ranking. The song features a slowed-down interpolation of Funkadelic's ""(Not Just) Knee Deep"" as its bassline and features Jewell on vocals and RBX on chorus.

The song was a diss towards rappers Eazy-E, Dre's former accomplice; Tim Dog, an East Coast rapper who slighted the whole West Coast rap scene; and Luther (Luke) Campbell, whose track ""Fakin' Like Gangstas"" from his debut solo album I Got Shit On My Mind (featuring JT Money from the group Poison Clan) was taken personally for making references to some of the popular rappers in the ""gangsta"" category. Snoop Dogg later made peace between him and Luke in the song Hoez from Smokefest Underground. ""Fuck Wit' Dre Day"" has an accompanying music video directed by Dr. Dre.
Eazy-E retaliated on his next album It's On (Dr. Dre) 187um Killa which contained the song ""Real Muthaphuckkin G's"", on which he makes fun of Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg (calling them ""studio gangstas""), and Death Row Records.

Tim Dog responded with ""Dog Baby"" and ""Bitch with a Perm"" — two tracks directed at Snoop Dogg. Tim Dog was angry at Snoop for his 2nd verse and line ""Tim Dog can eat a big fat dick"" at the end of the song, as well as the representation of the lines ""Fuck me in the ass!"" and ""Step to me and let me suck your dick!"" as ""things that Tim Dog would say"" in the skit track, ""The $20 Sack Pyramid"".

Luther Campbell along with JT Money and then-upcoming artist Clayvoisie responded with the song ""Cowards in Compton"" (from Luke's second solo LP, In The Nude) and its accompanying video that parodied Dre's original premise as a member of the mid-1980s rap group World Class Wreckin' Cru. On which Tweedy Bird Loc dissed Luther on ""Fucc Miami"" including ""Tha Shiznit"" where Snoop retaliated.

""Fuck Wit' Dre Day"" was included as a single for the video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, playing on West Coast hip hop radio station Radio Los Santos.

Snoop Dogg used and originated the word ""bootylicious"" in this song almost a decade before the 2001 single of that name by Destiny's Child. However, in this song it means ""bad"" or ""weak""; that is far different from the meaning Beyoncé Knowles gave it in her group's hit, which the Oxford English Dictionary Online used when it added ""bootylicious"" in 2004. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Dr.+Dre/_/Fuck+Wit+Dre+Day+(And+Everybody%27s+Celebratin%27)"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Light Speed Lyrics
Light Speed is the 9th track from Dre’s 1999 album, 2001.

This song contains the sample from Boogie Down Production’s I’m Still #1

This track was entirely ghostwritten by Hittman, who is also on the track.
[Intro: Dr. Dre & (girl)]
Hey... hey, whassup?
My name is Dre
Can I blaze some chronic witchu?
(
Nigga, what? Fo' sho'!
Roll that shit up!
)
Hell yeah
[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Still always into something
, heart still in Compton
The comp can't oppose, dope Cali platinum classicals
Introduced you to my Doggs, that don't love hoes
And Firm Fiascos
—assholes
Fucked you up with my last video, tuxed up doing a tango
And cash, always in my grasp
Came up in the game wearin' khakis not Kangols,
 
stranglin' hoes
When asked about it, in most interviews, I just laugh
Now I vacate with hoes with a gang of ass
One feedin' me mangos, the other lightin' my hash
Rap tabloids write ""Dre's light in the ass"" (What?)
Came home uptight, ready to mash
Like a gas pedal, 
get on that '64 Chevy level
AK-47 heavy metal
Who say Dre ain't ghetto? Just whistle like a tea kettle
I throw three at you, tell me if you see devils
'Cause we rebels over here, I smell chronic in the air
That means we takin' over this year, you hear?[Bridge: Girl, 
KRS-One sample
 & 
Dr. Dre
]
Chronic, 2000
""One!""
That means we takin' over this year, ya hear?
[Chorus: Ms. Roq & Knoc-Turn'al]
Light speed, blazin' chronic through the galaxy
Hydro, doja, chocolate Thai weed
Or we might be sippin' on gin or Hennessey
Fuck that, where that new shit, The Chronic Iced Teas?
[Verse 2: Hittman]
I hang among hustlers, I slang and hoo-bang Bronson
When bustaz roll through, can't fuck with my bold crew
We will hold you captive and bust
'Cause gangbangin' is the active activity
Where I be livin', B, there ain't no Liberty Statue
Hope you got your gat, don't let them catch you slippin'
Without yours, it's warfare outdoors
Ambulance, violent uproars
Trash niggas taken out like chores
I meet whores on tours
Jeanie's hot as pepper, so I sip champagne on stormy shores
Be on some hardcore, pornographic
Toting Austrian firearms that's made out of plastic
In these drastic surroundings, it be sounding like Lebanon
Makin' fools ""Retreat!"" like Megatron and Starscream
Oh, yeah, I scream on stars
That get loot then 
crossover like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
""Get out your car, son"" – that's how I came to bougie niggas at 
Bar One
It's either that or make front page stardom
I'm the Golden Child, chased by Sardo Numspay
But God's my bulletproof, it's hard to shoot me, you hear?
By the time you see him – {*two gun shots*}
That means it's real fuckin' hard to shoot me, you hear?[Chorus: Ms. Roq & Knoc-Turn'al]
Light speed, blazin' chronic through the galaxy
Hydro, doja, chocolate Thai weed

Outlaw State of Mind Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Cut my teeth on daddy's old LGO
And I lost my mind somewhere in New Mexico
And TW put a snake on my back
I keep a redbone on my side
[Chorus 1]
And there's people all across the land
From East Kentucky down to Alabam'
Whole lot like I am all the time
In an outlaw state of mind
[Verse 2]
I got friends that know how to have a good time
Yeah they roll their own and drink Carolina shine
I've seen the devil in a dark coal mine
I've been higher than a Georgia pine
[Chorus 2]
And there's people all across the land
From West Virginia to The Rio Grande
Whole lot like I am all the time
In an outlaw state of mind
[Chorus 3]
Yeah there's people all across the land
From New York out to old San Fran'
Just don't give a damn all the time
In an outlaw state of mind",https://genius.com/Chris-stapleton-outlaw-state-of-mind-lyrics,"",""

[Intro]
Don't do nothin' 'less your heart's in it
Heart's in it, heart's in it
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it
[Verse 1]
If you got a twenty for all of your tries
Twenty for all of the times
The times you got back up, woah
Could be a billionaire in a year
That's how you gotta think 'til you're there
On the regular
[Pre-Chorus]
If you had a diamond for all of your passion
Diamond for your dedication
You could be icy like caking
Icy for every occasion
Gotta go hard, yeah
That's all I'm condoning
Love is a component
You’re the only opponent
Gotta seize the moment
[Chorus]
And don't do nothin' 'less your heart's in it
Heart's in it, heart's in it
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it
Come again each time
'Til the water runs dry
Oh don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it[Post-Hook]
Oh, oh
Oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
[Verse 2]
If I had a guitar missing 5 strings
A guitar with only one string
I could only play one song, ooh
A simple melody
Simple enough to make the world sing
Strong enough to make your mood swing
You know what I mean
[Pre-Chorus]
If you had a diamond for all of your passion
Diamond for your dedication
You could be icy like caking
Icy for every occasion
Gotta go hard, yeah
That's all I'm condoning
Love is a component
You're the only opponent
Gotta seize the moment
[Chorus]
And don't do nothin' 'less your heart's in it
Heart's in it, heart's in it
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it
Come again each time
'Til the water runs dry
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it[Post-Hook]
Oh, oh
Oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
All in it, all in it
[Vamp]
See, growing up, I
I always felt like I had to be the best at everything
Cause I, I just didn't think I was good enough
And, and maybe if I was good at something that I'd get recognition from that but
I quickly found out that I wasn't gonna get the recognition that I wanted or that I needed because
Because people aren't perfect and by not being perfect you sometimes can disappoint people
And with God it's like he's perfect
And he never disappoints
So I just get my recognition from him
And give him recognition",https://genius.com/Justin-bieber-all-in-it-lyrics,"“All In It” is a song by Justin Bieber on the deluxe edition of his highly anticipated album Purpose. Justin mentioned the song during a radio interview earlier this year.

[Verse 1]
It's like you got superpowers
Turn my minutes into hours
You got more than 20/20, babe
Made of glass, the way you see through me
You know me better than I do
Can't seem to keep nothin' from you
How you touch my soul from the outside
Permeate my ego and my pride

I wanna love me (Ooh)
The way that you love me (Ooh)
Ooh, for all of my pretty and all of my ugly too
I'd love to see me from your point of view
I wanna trust me (Trust me)
The way that you trust me (Trust me)
Ooh, 'cause nobody ever loved me like you do
I'd love to see me from your point of view

Still gеtting good at not leaving
I'ma love you even though I'm scared (Oh, scared)
Learnin' to be grateful for myself (Oh, oh, oh)
You love my lips 'cause they say the
Things we've always been afraid of
I can feel it startin' to subside
Learnin' to believe in what is mine[Chorus]
I wanna love me (Ooh)

Know I be impatient
But now I'm out here, fallin', fallin'
Frozen, slowly thawin', got me right
I won't keep you waitin', waitin'
All my baggage fadin' safely (My baggage fadin')
And if my eyes deceive me
Won't let them stray too far away

The way that you love me (Ooh)
Ooh, for all of my pretty and all of my ugly too
I'd love to see me from your point of view

Soulless Friends Lyrics
Walk with me, my soulless friends
You are what I need
You've always been
Baby I know
But I won't dissolve
Something sweet
Something soft
Sometimes when I live it up
In time
What I feel, what I see
I know
That it ends
That it ends
Walk with me, my soulless friends
You are what I need, 
instruments
Maybe I know
But I don't recall
Why I'm weak, you so strong
Sometimes when I give it up
In time
What I need, I've got to hear
I know
That it ends
That it endsSometimes when I give it up
In time
What I need, I've got to cease
I know
I know
I know
That it ends
That it ends
That it ends",https://genius.com/Peter-cat-recording-co-soulless-friends-lyrics,"",""

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
Bad luck to talk on these rides
Mind on the road, your dilated eyes watch the clouds float
White Ferrari, had a good time
Sweet sixteen, how was I supposed to know anything? (Love)
I let you out at Central
I didn't care to state the plain
Kept my mouth closed
We're both so familiar
White Ferrari, good times
[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Stick by me, close by me
You were fine, you were fine here
That's just a slow body
You left when I forgot to speak
So I text the speech, lesser speeds, Texas speed, yes
Basic takes its toll on me 'ventually, 'ventually, yes
Ah, on me 'ventually, 'ventually, yes
I care for you still, and I will forever
That was my part of the deal, honest
We got so familiar
Spending each day of the year
White Ferrari, good times
[Bridge: Frank Ocean & 
Kanye West
]
In this life (Life), in this life (Life)
One too many years
Some tattooed eyelids on a facelift
Thought you might want to know now
Mind over matter is magic, I do magic
If you think about it, it'll be over in no time
And that's life
 
(Love)
Love (
Love
)[Verse 3: Frank Ocean]
I'm sure we're taller in another dimension
You say we're small and not worth the mention
You're tired of movin' (Woo), your body's achin' (Woah)
We could vacay, there's places to go
Clearly, this isn't (The way) all that there is
Can't take what's been given (No way)
But we're so okay here (We're fine), we're doing fine (We're fine)
Primal and naked
You dream of walls that hold us in prison (Love)
It's just a skull, least that's what they call it
And we're free to roam",https://genius.com/Frank-ocean-white-ferrari-lyrics,"This cut from Channel Orange is a relaxed instrumental version of Frank’s song “White” from The Odd Future Tape Vol. 2.

[Verse 1]
The way you move is like a full on rainstorm and I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless that should send me runnin'
But I kinda know that I won't get far
And you stood there in front of me, just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see what I was thinkin' of
[Chorus]
Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
[Verse 2]
My mind forgets to remind me you're a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really somethin'
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you, I know it's no good
And I could wait patiently, but I really wish you would
[Chorus]
Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile[Bridge]
I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keepin' your eyes on me, it's just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase, won't you whisper soft and slow?
I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show

Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk (Ah-ah), take away the pain

Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down

But I wish I was dead (Dead like you)
[Chorus]
Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side
Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side[Verse 2]
All my friends ask me why I stay strong
Tell 'em, ""When you find true love, it lives on""
Ah, that's why I stay here
[Pre-Chorus]
And there's no remedy for memory
Your face is like a melody
It won't leave my head
Your soul is hauntin' me
And tellin' me that everything is fine
But I wish I was dead (Dead like you)
[Chorus]
Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side
Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
But there's no you, except in my dreams tonight
[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, ha-ha-ha-ha
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight
Oh-oh-oh-oh, ha-ha-ha-ha
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight[Bridge]
There's no relief, I see you in my sleep
And everybody's rushin' me
But I can feel you touchin' me
There's no release, I feel you in my dreams
Tellin' me I'm fine
[Chorus]
Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side (So tell me)
Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
But there's no you, except in my dreams tonight

The outro repeats the desire not to wake up from the dream of being with the loved one. Overall, ""Dark Paradise"" is a sorrowful and nostalgic song that explores the pain of losing a loved one and the struggle to let go.

Goddamn, man-child
You fucked me so good that I almost said ""I love you""
You're fun and you’re wild
But you don't know the half of the shit that you put me through
Your poetry's bad and you blame the news
But I can’t change that, and I can't change your mood, ah
[Chorus]
'Cause you're just a man
It's just what you do
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Yeah, you're just a man
All through and through
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Blue, blue, blue
[Verse 2]
Goddamn, man-child
You act like a kid even though you stand six foot two
Self-loathing poet, resident Laurel Canyon know-it-all
You talk to the walls when the party gets bored of you
But I don't get bored, I just see it through
Why wait for the best when I could have you? You?[Chorus]
'Cause you’re just a man
It’s just what you do
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Yeah, you're just a man
All through and through
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue

You make me blue

[Intro: Kanye West]
Oh, yeah
I got the perfect song for the kids to sing
And all my people that's—
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack your money 'til it get sky high
We wasn't s'posed to make it past twenty-five
Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
""We don't care what people say"" (Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh)
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
If this is your first time hearin' this
You are about to experience somethin' so cold, man
We never had nothin' handed, took nothin' for granted
Took nothin' from no man, man, I'm my own man
But as a shorty, I looked up to the dope man
Only adult man I knew that wasn't broke, man
Flicking Starter coats, man—man, you don't know, man
We don't care what people say
This is for my niggas outside all winter
'Cause this summer, they ain't finna say, ""Next summer, I'm finna...""
Sittin' in the hood like community colleges
This dope money here is Lil' Trey's scholarship
'Cause ain't no tuition for having no ambition
And ain't no loans for sittin' your ass at home
So we forced to sell crack, rap, and get a job
You gotta do somethin', man, your ass is grown[Chorus: Kanye West 
with 
Choir
]
Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack your money 'til it get sky high
Kids, sing! Kids, sing!
We wasn't s'posed to make it past twenty-five
Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
""We don't care what people say""
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
This second verse is for my dogs working nine to five that still hustle
'Cause a nigga can't shine off $6.55
And everybody sellin' makeup, Jacob's
And bootleg tapes just to get they cake up
We put shit on layaway, then come back
We claim other people kids on our income tax
We take that money, cop work, then push packs to get paid
And we don't care what people say
Mama say she wanna move South
Scratching lottery tickets, eyes on a new house
'Round the same time, Doe ran up in dude house
Couldn't get a job
So since he couldn't get work, he figured he'd take work
The drug game bulimic, it's hard to get weight
So niggas' money is homo, it's hard to get straight
But we gon' keep bakin' 'til the day we get cake
And we don't care what people say, my niggas—[Chorus: Kanye West & Choir, 
Kanye West
]
Drug dealin' just to get by (
Yeah
)
Stack your money 'til it get sky high
Kids, sing! Kids, sing!

Alive
)
Throw your hands up in the sky and say (
Uh-huh, yeah
)
""We don't care what people say"" (
Yeah, yeah, ugh

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
You know the kids gon' act a fool
When you stop the programs for after school
And they DCFS,
 
some of 'em dyslexic
They favorite 50 Cent song ""12 Questions""
We scream: ""Rocks, blows, weed, park,"" see, now we smart
We ain't retards the way teachers thought
Hold up, hold fast, we make more cash
Now, tell my mama I belong in that slow class
It's bad enough we on welfare
You tryna put me on the school bus with the space for the wheelchair
I'm tryna get the car with the chromey wheels here
You tryna cut our lights out like we don't live here
Look what was handed us, fathers abandoned us
When we get them hammers, go on, call the ambulance
Sometimes, I feel no one in this world understands us
But we don't care what people say, my niggas—[Chorus: Kanye West & Choir,

Niggas wanna flex on me and be in L.A. for free, huh?

[Verse 1]
Hey, love
Yeah, I lost you, babe
Pickin' up a penny with a press-on is
Easier than holding you down
Can't be any harder than holding you up now
To come clean I said, to be real is (To come clean is to come clean)
To be real, it's
Probably true what they say about me
Probably came from my inner circle
It usually come from your inner circle
Or lack thereof and I don't know who I can trust
I've been droppin' out and
I've been hangin' out with my high friends
And we too stoned to pay attention now
(Much too cool for seventh grade)
I mean really, it's same me, it's old me
You know? Same shit
I've been on the low-key grinding
(Grinding, grinding, grinding, grinding, grinding)
Learning on the low-key, shining
Tryin' to keep to myself
But you bring me out of character
Every time again
[Chorus]
Damn, Gina, damn, Gina
Them jeans, they must be uptight, mama
You need some get right, mama
Go, Gina, go, Gina (Still works for me, it works for me, no)
Go get that get right, mama (It works for me, it works for me, no)
Go, Gina, go, Gina (Still works for me, it works for me, no)
Go 'til you get right, mama (It works for me, it works for me, no)[Verse 2]
I belong to nobody, hope it don't bother you
You could mind your business
I belong to nobody, try not to disturb or
Mind my business

Still works for me, it works for me, no
It works for me, it works for me, no (Go, Gina, go, Gina)
Still works for me, it works for me, no

In a Breakfast Club interview, SZA explains that the song ties in to the character, Gina (portrayed by Tisha Campbell-Martin) from the 1992 sitcom Martin. SZA believes that if the character Gina didn’t work so much and just had a good time like her friends, then she would have a more fun and enjoyable life.

“Go Gina” is used two different ways in this song. The most important line in the first verse is the last line….“you bring me out of character everytime again..” She is referencing whoever it is that has been talking about her or saying things about her that are not true. “Damn Gina” was also used on Martin in a negative way. When she would make Martin mad or mess something up, Martin would say….“Daaaaammmmnnn Ginnnnaaa” as if to say, here you go again. Now look back at the first verse and you get the sense that she is saying “Damn Gina” like here you go again with your stuck up self, talking about me when I’m doing me and living my life.“ “Them jeans must be uptight” simply references how stuck up the person is and “get right” means they need to relax and go until they actually GET RIGHT, with themselves and learn how to live a little.

The second verse is SZA explaining that she is free to do whatever she wants. Perhaps, she used to be like Gina, uptight and now she is doing her. This is where “go gina” is used in the positive, like a praise, a compliment, the way Martin used to say….“you go girl!” <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/SZA/_/Go+Gina"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Beyoncé - ALLIIGATOR TEARS (Русский перевод)
ALLIIGATOR TEARS Lyrics
[Verse 1]
High tides in the city, I'm in too deep
And I'm runnin' on fear
Oh, dear, you and your alligator tears
Works me over and through
[Chorus]
You say
 move a mountain
And I'll throw on my boots
You say stop the river from runnin'
I'll build a dam or two
You say change religions
Now, I spend Sundays with you
Somethin' 'bout those tears of yours
How does it feel to be adored?
[Post-Chorus]
You and your alligator tears
You and those alligator tears
You
Somethin' 'bout those tears of yours
How does it feel to be adored?
[Verse 2]
Sunrise in the morning, you're all I need
And all I need is rain or the roots get weak
Sweet things need time to grow
Thinkin' 'bout leaving? Hell no
Squeeze every ounce of love from my body,
 
yеah[Chorus]
You say move a mountain
And I'll throw on my boots
You say stop the river from runnin'
I'll build a dam or two
You say changе religion
Now, I spend Sundays with you
Somethin' 'bout those tears of yours
How does it feel to be adored?
[Outro]
I adore you, I adore you, I adore you, I adore you
Those alligator tears
I adore you, I adore you, I adore you, I adore you
Your alligator tears
I adore you, I adore you, I adore you, I adore
Alligator tears
I adore, I adore you, I adore you, I adore, I adore (How does it feel to be adored?)

Lonely Weekend Lyrics
Kacey grapples with conflicting emotions – she feels lonely, but at the same time, she accepts that she’s alone in that moment and knows it’s not permanent.  She is honest with herself and shares that with us
[Intro]
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely weekend
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely feelin' without you
[Verse 1]
Monday, I was gone and Tuesday, you were working late
Wednesday went to hell then Thursday kinda had to wait, yeah
Friday, you were leavin', goin' out of town again
I should see what's goin' on, only got a couple friends
[Chorus]
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely weekend (So lonely)
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely feelin' without you
Guess everybody else is out tonight (Out tonight)
Guess I'm hangin' by myself, but I don't mind (I don't mind)
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely weekend, yeah
[Verse 2]
I got a million things to do, but I haven't done a single one, oh-oh
And if my sister lived in town, I know that we'd be doin' something fun, mmm
I keep lookin' at my phone, puttin' it back down
There's a little part of me that's got the fear of missin' out and
[Chorus]
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely weekend (So lonely)
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely feelin' without you
I guess everybody else is out tonight (Out tonight)
Guess I'm hangin' by myself, but I don't mind (I don't mind)
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely weekend, yeah[Bridge]
Even if you got somebody on your mind
It's alright to be alone sometimes
Sometimes
[Chorus]
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely weekend (So lonely)
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely feelin' without you
I guess everybody else is out tonight (Out tonight)

""History"" peaked at number six on the UK Singles Chart.

“History” was written by members Liam Payne and Louis Tomlinson, along with Wayne Hector, Ed Drewett and the band's regular collaborators Julian Bunetta and John Ryan.

The song was chosen as the third and final single from ""Made in the A.M."" after the commercial success that followed the band's performance on the finale of British The X Factor. The song was released by Syco Music on 6 November 2015 and served as the band's last single before their hiatus.

The music video, directed by Ben Winston, was released on the band's Vevo channel, via YouTube, on 26 January 2016. It features clips of the band throughout the years, highlighting their tours and personal anecdotes and including clips of former member Zayn Malik. The video ends as the band walk off in separate directions; it was later confirmed that the band were originally supposed to run back together. Director Winston said, ""The ending wasn't supposed to look like they're just walking off in different directions, it was kind of like a 'see you in a bit, guys.'"" In 2017, the deleted clip was unveiled online. ""History"" was the last song released before the band's end. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/One+Direction/_/History"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

[Verse 1]
I like to fuck with you just to make up with you
'Cause the way you be screamin’ my name
Make me wanna make love to you
I might break up with you just to make up with you
At the end of the day, boy
You know that I'm 'bout to wake up with you
[Chorus]
I love it when we make up (Yeah-eh-eh)
Go ’head, ruin my makeup (Yeah-eh-eh)
I love it when we make up (Yeah-eh-eh)
Go 'head, ruin my makeup (Yeah-eh-eh)
[Verse 2]
My energy and attitude don't really coincide
I'm stayin' mad all day so we can let it out tonight
Bring you to the bed where we can really make it right
Sorry-in-a-box so when it pops, surprise, surprise

I love it when we make up (Yeah-eh-eh)
Go 'head, ruin my makeup (Yeah-eh-eh)

Go 'head, ruin my makeup (Yeah-eh-eh)[Verse 3]
Promise me that when you kiss my lips, you'll make it stick
That’s the way to shut me up after an argument
No eyeliner on, but looking at you is the fix
Highlight of my life, just like that Fenty Beauty kit
Boy, you know what it is

And I find that it works every time

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please, tell me
'Cause one second, it was perfect
Now, you're halfway out the door
[Chorus]
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, ""Forever and always""
Oh, and it 
rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, ""Forever and always""
[Verse 2]
Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now, I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore[Chorus]
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, ""Forever and always""
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom

It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone

Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?

[Verse 1]
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearin' a gown shaped like a pastry
[Pre-Chorus]
This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say
[Chorus]
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, ""Speak now""
[Verse 2]
Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be[Pre-Chorus]
She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me, don't you?
[Chorus]
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, ""Speak now""
Don't say yes, run away now (Run away now)
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow (Say a single vow)
Your time is running out
And they said, ""Speak now""
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh (Run away now), la
Ooh (Say a single vow), ooh
[Bridge]
I hear the preacher say
""Speak now or forever hold your peace""
There's the silence, there's my last chance
I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I'm only lookin' at you[Verse 3]
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl, haha
[Chorus]
So, don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
They said, ""Speak now""
And you say, ""Let's run away now (Run away now)
I'll meet you when I'm out
Of my tux, at the back door
Baby, I didn't say my vows (Say a single vow)
So glad you were around

I'll go with you. I'll play guitar. It would be great.' She was just kind of laughing, and later on I just was wrapping my mind around that idea of how tragic it would be if someone you loved was marrying somebody else.

Later I had a dream about one of my ex-boyfriends getting married, and it just all came together that I needed to write this song about interrupting a wedding. For me, I like to think of it as good versus evil, and this girl is so completely painted as the evil one.

[Verse 1: Hittman]
It was just one of those days when I wanted to catch sunrays
It's fun to get blunted on a Sunday
Afternoon, nigga bathed, got groomed
Grabbed the gat for misbehaviors and the chocolate flavored boom
Lost in hip-hop tunes
, zoom-zoom like the 
Commodores
Wonder will we have drama, or
End up clowning whores and round up four good-to-go girls
Like them 
Barbary Coast girls
Riding shotgun
, baby, I be postin' all-world in the ride
Sipping 151
 done gave me too much pride to back down
Soon as we get to The Beach I'ma put my fuckin' mack down
I'm playin' lead, not the background
It's time to put 
Bronson
 on the map now
Walk with my hand on my Johnson, crack a smile
Cuties peep my style, if I don't get some 
ackrite
, I'ma have to act wild[Chorus: Hittman & 
Dr. Dre
]
Blunt in my left hand, drink in my right
Strap by my waistline, 'cause niggas don't fight
Sucker-free for life, so you better think twice
Aight? And a give a nig' some ackrite
I'm the type of nigga player haters don't like
Snatchin' up your honey for some late night hype
And snobby-ass bitches get slapped out of spite
Aight? And a give a nig' some ackrite
[Verse 2: Hittman]
Uh, drink kicking in, I'm still elated
For those that don't know big words, I'm fuckin' faded
Eighty-three degrees, ease to a shaded spot
Our first spot was cool 'til some gangsters made it hot
Now we plot and pose, 
plus we watchin' hoes
With lots of flesh exposed getting swarmed by those
Type of niggas with no game but brown-nose
So I impose only like pros can
""Yo, is this your man?"" ""No,"" grab the bitch's hand
""I'm Hittman,""
, bling, gold chain gleam
""You're very eligible for my summer league team""
Maybe too extreme, 'cause the sister got steamed
Then miss thing tried to scream on my brethren
I got mad, spit flame on the name Stefan
Tattooed on her arm, 
ho, you ain't the bomb
Must be a dyke, get your lips swole or give a nig' some ackrite[Chorus: Hittman & 
Dr. Dre
]
Blunt in my left hand, drink in my right
Strap by my waistline, 'cause niggas don't fight

Snatchin' up your honey for some late night hype
And snobby-ass bitches get slapped out of spite
Aight? And a give a nig' some ackrite
[Verse 3: Hittman]
Fronting on the ackrite causes me to act up
Good Samaritans saved that ho from getting slapped up
My homies crack up at the scene I made
Yo, my actions ain't serene when a nigga's on fade
If it wasn't for the one-time brigade, I woulda sprayed at the hooker tramp
As cops parade. I'm afraid it's time to break camp, make tracks
Where else can we go to take hoes from fake macks?
Ayo, chase them girls in that black Maxima, the passenger
Almost fractured her neckbone looking back at us
Plus, they on the dick cause the Caddy's plush
They blush, I bumrush
 the hus'
 with the largest crush
Try to swing her after night so I don't have to keep in touch
Keep it on the hush without the tippin'
Macking interrupted by some niggas set trippin'
Clip in the strap, I showed these niggas how to act[Chorus: Hittman & 
Dr. Dre

Snatchin' up your honey for some late night hype
And snobby-ass bitches get slapped out of spite

Biotch (
Yeah

I just wanna put my dick on your shoulder so you could put it on your mind later on
Step it up!
Take that dick off your shoulder, and put it in your mouth!
Drink the evidence and hide the dick behind your head

Subjected to my system
Reflecting on the days
When we used to be just friends
Protected both our interest
Our trust was in a bank
That's where our hearts were safe
[Pre-Chorus]
And then we got closer
Separated from my ex
So we got closer
Oh, in every visit
Feelings got stronger
Now this is out our hands
Our love is here to stay

So get used to me checking in
All day
Get used to me falling through
Just to see your face
There ain't a moment

Forever if I May

As long as you stand right by my side

Keep growing closer
Throughout October
Oh counting down, it's almost Christmas Eve

With tangerine trees and marmalade skies

Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes

Many people thought this was about drugs, since the letters ""LSD"" are prominent in the title, and John Lennon, who wrote it, was known to have taken acid. In 1971 Lennon told Rolling Stone that he swore that he had no idea that the song's initials spelled L.S.D. He added: ""I didn't even see it on the label. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/Lucy+in+the+Sky+with+Diamonds"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"" is a song written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney that was recorded by The Beatles for their 1967 album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.

Many people thought this was about drugs, since the letters ""LSD"" are prominent in the title, and John Lennon, who wrote it, was known to have taken acid. In 1971 Lennon told Rolling Stone that he swore that he had no idea that the song's initials spelled L.S.D. He added: ""I didn't even see it on the label. I didn't look at the initials. I don't look— I mean I never play things backwards. I listened to it as I made it. It's like there will be things on this one, if you fiddle about with it. I don't know what they are. Every time after that though I would look at the titles to see what it said, and usually they never said anything.""

Paul McCartney recounted trading lyric ideas with Lennon in an interview, saying, ""We never noticed the LSD initial until it was pointed out later, by which point people didn't believe us."" This is confirmed by a 1971 interview of Lennon, where he described searching for acronyms in other song titles only to find ""they didn't spell out anything."" In an interview with Playboy, published in 1981, Lennon revealed the true background of the song: ""My son Julian came in one day with a picture he painted about a school friend of his named Lucy. He had sketched in some stars in the sky and called it 'Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,' Simple."" George Martin also denied the song was about LSD in the book The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions by Mark Lewisohn.

However, Lewisohn goes on to say ""there can be little doubt that this was the very substance that provoked such colourful word imagery to flow out of Lennon's head and onto paper."" McCartney agrees in a 2004 interview, where he noted that Julian's painting had inspired the song, but that it was ""pretty obvious"" that the song was also inspired by LSD. For his part, Lennon attributed the colourful prose not to the drug, but to the writings of Carroll. George Martin also accredits the influence of Carroll and Dylan Thomas on Lennon.

[Verse 1]
'Round your city, 'round the clock
Everybody needs you
No, you can't make everybody equal
Although you got beaucoup family
You don't even got nobody bein' honest with you
Breathe 'til I evaporated
My whole body see-through
Transportation, handmade (G)
And I know it better than most people
I don't trust 'em anyways
You can't break the law with them
Get some gushy, have a calm night
Shooters killin' left and right
Workin' through your worst night
If I get my money right
You know I won't need you
And I tell you (Bitch)
I hope the sack is full up
I'm fuckin', no, I'm fucked up
Spend it when I get that
I ain't tryna keep you
Can't keep up a conversation
Can't nobody reach you
Why your eyes well up? (Breathe)
Did you call me from a séance?
You are from my past life
Hope you're doin' well, bruh (Breathe)
I been out here head first
Always like the head first
Signal comin' in and out
Hope you're doin' well, bruh
Everybody needs you
Everybody needs you

No sleep in my body
Ain't no bitch in my body (Ah)[Pre-Chorus]
New beginnings, ahh
New beginnings, wake up, akh

Time to start your day, bruh
Can't keep bein' laid off
Know you need the money if you gon' survive
Every night shit, every day shit

Droppin' baby off at home before my night shift
You know I can't hear none of that ""spend the night"" shit

Wanna see nirvana, but don't wanna die yet
Wanna feel that 'na-'na, though, could you come by?
Fuck wit' me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down and shit
Bummed out and shit, stressed out and shit

Shut the fuck up, I don't want your conversation
Rollin' marijuana, that's a cheap vacation

All my night, been ready for you all my night
Been waitin' on you all my night
I'll buzz you in, just let me know when you're outside
All my night, you been missin' all my night
Still got some good nights memorized
And the look back's gettin' me right[Part II]

Every night fucks every day up
Every day patches the night up (Night, come on)
On God, you should match it, it's that KO (That KO, God)
No white lighters 'til I fuck my twenty-eighth up (Fire)
1998, my family had that Acura (Fire)
Oh, the Legend (Fire)
Kept at least six discs in the changer (Yeah-yeah)
Back when Boswell and Percy had it active (Massive)
Couple bishops in the city buildin' mansions (Massive)
All the reverends (Massive, massive, ooh)
Preachin' self-made millionaire status (Yeah, yeah)
When we could only eat at Shoney's on occasion (Yeah, yeah)
After 'Trina hit, I had to transfer campus (Yeah, yeah)
Your apartment out in Houston's where I waited (Yeah, yeah, ooh)
Stayin' with you when I didn't have a address (Ooh)
Fuckin' on you when I didn't own a mattress (Fuckin')
Workin' on a way to make it outta Texas
Every night (Right now, right now, right now)

Droppin' baby off at home before my night shift, yeah
You know I can't hear none of that ""spend the night"" shit
That kumbaya shit
Want to see nirvana, but don't wanna die yet
Wanna feel that 'na-'na, though, could you come by?
Fuck wit' me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down
Bummed out, stressed out
That's just every day shit
Shut the fuck up, I don't want your conversation
Rollin' marijuana, that's a cheap vacation (Day shit)

How Bad Do U Want Me Lyrics
[Verse 1]
The good girl in your dreams
Is mad you're lovin' me
I know you wish that she was me
How bad, bad do you want me?
You're not the guy that cheats (The guy that cheats)
And you're afraid that she might leave (That she might leave)
'Cause if I get too close, she might scream
""How bad, bad do you want me?""
[Chorus]
'Cause you like my hair, my ripped-up jeans
You like the bad girl I got in me
She's on your mind, like, all the time
But I got a tattoo for us last week
Even good boys bleed
How bad, bad do you want me? (How bad, bad do you want me?)
(How bad, bad do you want me?)
'Cause you hate thе crash, but you love the rush
And I'll make your hеart weak every time
You hear my name, 'cause she's in your brain
And I'm here to kiss you in real life
'Bout to cause a scene
How bad, bad do you want me?
[Verse 2]
You panic in your sleep (Panic in your sleep)
And you feel like such a creep (Feel like such a creep)
'Cause with your eyes closed, you might peek
So hot, hot that you can't speak
You're so fucked up with your crew (Fucked up with your crew)
But when you're all alone, it's true (All alone, it's true)
You know exactly what we'd do
How bad, bad do you want to?[Chorus]
'Cause you like my hair, my ripped-up jeans
You like the bad girl I got in me
She's on your mind, like, all the time
But I got a tattoo for us last week
Even good boys bleed
How bad, bad do you want me? (How bad, bad do you want me?)
(How bad, bad do you want me?)

And I'll make your heart weak every time
You hear my name, 'cause she's in your brain
And I'm here to kiss you in real life

[Post-Chorus]
Uh-oh, oh, you love a good girl
Uh-oh, oh, you love a good girl bad
Uh-oh, oh, you make a bad girl
Uh-oh, oh, you make a bad girl mad
A psychotic love theme
How bad do you want me?
[Bridge]
That girl in your head ain't real
How bad do you want me, for real? (Oh)[Chorus]
'Cause you like my hair, my ripped-up jeans
You like the bad girl I got in me
She's on your mind, like, all the time
But I got a tattoo for us last week
Even good boys bleed
How bad, bad do you want me? (How bad, bad do you want me?)
(How bad? Tell me)
'Cause you hate the crash, but you love the rush
And I'll make your heart weak every time
You hear my name, but she's in your brain
And I'm here to kiss you in real life
'Bout to cause a scene
How bad, bad do you want me?

Still I get so hesitant, still I get so hesitant
So I took myself where I think I should be
Something told me that it's waiting here for me
Parisian nights, Parisian high, Parisian breeze
Feeding me like medicine, feeding me like medicine, yeah
[Chorus]
It's so romantic in Paris
Won't even try to compare it
Thought I was sure that I'd find it
But I already have love in L.A. 
It's so romantic in Paris
Won't even try to compare it
Thought I was sure that I'd find it
But I already have love in L.A. 
Yeah, I already have love in L.A. 
[Verse 2]
If you show me too much love, it makes me leave (Makes me leave)
Guess that's one of many things that's wrong with me (That's wrong with me)
Looking past you when you're right in front of me
I won't do that anymore, I won't do that anymore (Anymore)
Why'd it take so long for me to know this? (Know this)
Scared to put the water with the roses (Roses)
Halfway 'cross the world for me to notice
But I notice, yeah, I notice, yeah[Chorus]
It's so romantic in Paris
Won't even try to compare it
Thought I was sure that I'd find it
But I already have love in L.A. 
It's so romantic in Paris
Won't even try to compare it
Thought I was sure that I'd find it
But I already have love in L.A. 
[Bridge]
Je ne voulais pas trouver l'amour
Mais Paris a quelque chose
Qui donne envie d'aimer, d'aimer passionnément
Mon cœur est à toi pour toujours
You will always have my heart
[Chorus]
It's so romantic in Paris
Won't even try to compare it
Thought I was sure that I'd find it
But I already have love in L.A. (
Already have love
)
It's so romantic in Paris (
So romantic in Paris
)
Won't even try to compare it (
I know that I try
)
Thought I was sure that I'd find it
But I already have love in L.A. 
It's so romantic in Paris, babe
Won't even try to compare it (
Won't even try, won't even try
)
Thought I was sure that I'd find it (
Thought I was sure, I was sure
)
But I already have love in L.A.

From the beginning, it was ending
We were emotionally pending
Jeopardy, second guessing
Got all the questions to my answers

Keep runnin' over me with your lovin'
I'm only right here for your consumption
Keep runnin' over me with your lovin'
Lookin' like it's turnin' into something
[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Wednesday
It feel like a Tuesday when you met me
I remember it like it was yesterday
You just said, ""Hello,"" I lost my sanity
Thought you was lookin' through me
Then you made me laugh with personality
When you said goodbye that was a tragedy
Had to get a lesson in anatomy
You just ran me over
Look out, watch out, got me on the defense
Thought love at first sight was just a false pretense
Took my hat off, made me pledge allegiance
Everything was in divine sequence[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Keep runnin' over me with your lovin'
I'm only right here for your consumption
Keep runnin' over me with your lovin'

Better that than turnin' into nothing (Way-oh, way-oh)

LD, uh
I believe in love
Girl, you got my hopes all up
When I left you, when I met you
I called mom and told her 'bout it
I got all up on your IG and was scrollin' down for hours
I got back to 2015 and you started lookin' young, so I stopped (Ooh)
Post intercourse when you walk by (Ass, ass, ass)
More buns than a Shop Rite (Woah)
And you wanna sleep over my crib?
Let me go and get you a soft t-shirt, here (Soft tee)
What are our kids gonna be like? (Hmm)
What is your skin routine like?
Girl, just run around bed with me
I'll flirt with you all cleverly
I'll lock you down, Pat Beverley
I'll kiss your breasts all tenderly, what's up? (Breast)
How you so hot and cute? (How?)
I wanna make a language up with you
You're already drivin' me crazy, so just[Chorus: Justin Bieber]

A lengthy, high-quality snippet of the song was leaked online on June 25, 2018. Shortly after, producer FARRI, who might have mistaken the instrumental for one that he produced, took to Twitter and announced that he was disappointed about the leak, claiming he would upload it to SoundCloud. The tweets have since been deleted. Later, on July 23, 2018, Music Mafia put the song up for sale on their website. Regardless, the song was updated and included on the album anyway.
The title is also a reference to the popular song “Californication” by Red Hot Chili Peppers. Interestingly, in an interview with Complex, producer Sevn Thomas explained that he even titled the instrumental “Californication” after it was finished. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Travis+Scott/_/HOUSTONFORNICATION"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

I won't lie to you
I know he's just not right for you
And you can tell me if I'm off, but I see it on your face
When you say that he's the one that you want
And you're spending all your time in this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop
[Chorus]
I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me, why are we wasting time
On all your wasted cryin'
When you should be with me instead?
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
[Verse 2]
I'll stop time for you
The second you say you'd like me to
I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
Baby, just to wake up with you
Would be everything I need and this could be so different
Tell me what you want to do

'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me, why are we wasting time

Better than he can
Better than he can[Bridge]
Give me a sign
Take my hand, we'll be fine
Promise I won't let you down
Just know that you don't
Have to do this alone
Promise I'll never let you down

Lyrically, Mendes sings to his romantic interest, promising to be a better boyfriend than the one she currently has. There was some speculation that this song was about Camila Cabello, the Fifth Harmony member who was rumored to have been dating Mendes in 2016. Both of them, however, insist that they’re just friends.

In Seventeen, Mendes did talk about how he’s matured since his last album, referencing a past relationship:

I have songs about growing up, about ex-relationships—ex-relationship, I should say. I haven’t had relationships. A couple of songs about relationships with girls since fame.

This song’s instrumentation is heavy on guitar. Teddy Geiger and Scott Harris helped pen the lyrics (they were behind two of the major hits on Mendes' previous album Handwritten). Gieger contributed to production alongside Dan Romer, a veteran in the music industry who’s also worked with film, most notably scoring 2011’s Beasts of the Southern Wild. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Shawn+Mendes/_/Treat+You+Better"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

[Intro: Justin Bieber]
Happy birthday
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
You ain't gotta question it
You already know the answer
The truth'll make us relevant
Hurts but it's necessary
Don't want us to lose what we are, no
Don't want us to lose what we are
Lose what we are
[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
If it ain't broke then we don't need to fix it
Believing in that she say'll have you livid
No they won't be happy 'til your love is over
They tryna break us up but you don't wanna get it
They ain't never had your back like I got it
They ain’t never had trust like how we got it
So they can't help but to come and hate on it
They see what we got and you know they want it
Don't question it
[Hook: Justin Bieber]
You ain't gotta question it
You already know the answer
The truth'll make us relevant
Hurts but it's necessary
Don't want us to lose what we are, no
Don't want us to lose what we are
Lose what we are[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
It's like you're always looking for a problem
But there ain't enough equations for you to solve 'em
So quick to turn nothin' right into somethin'
Take the numbers out my phone, go 'head and call 'em
They ain’t ever had my back like you got it
They ain't never had a chance, how you got it
So they can't help but to come and hate on it
They see what we got and you know they want it, don't question it
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
You ain't gotta question it
You already know the answer
The truth'll make us relevant
Hurts but it's necessary (yeah)
Don't want us to lose what we are
(Don't wanna lose, no)
Don't want us to lose what we are
Lose what we are
[Verse 3: Nas]
She texts me ""How's you love life?""
And ""How are you?"", I said ""I'm good""
They only get as close as you allow them to
We should be closer together
Warm oceans, better weather
Instead of us playing games forever
She says whatever
I says whatever
Who get you wetter than the half moon wearer?
HSTRY sweater
Serendipity when you with me
Swear you love that one thing we did
That one time in that one place
Blew your mind, you got my mind gone when I'm home
I'm serious girl, a much older dude, a whole 42
I've accomplished my goals, it's only you
You and I in that Wraith, retired my pimp super-fly cape
Just my Mets cap and my batch and I'm straight
Esco[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
You ain't gotta question it, oh
You already know the answer
The truth'll make us relevant

I got my peaches out in Georgia (Oh, yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (That's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (Badass bitch)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (Yeah, that’s it)
[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
And I say, oh (Oh)
The way I breathe you in (In)
It's the texture of your skin
I wanna wrap my arms around you, baby
Never let you go, oh
And I say, oh
There's nothing like your touch
It’s the way you lift me up, yeah
And I'll be right here with you 'til the end of time

You ain't sure yet
But I'm for ya
All I can want, all I can wish for
Nights alone that we miss more
And days we save as souvenirs
There's no time, I wanna make more time
And give you my whole life
I left my girl, I’m in Mallorca
Hate to leave her, call it torture
Remember when I couldn’t hold her
Left her baggage for Rimowa[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I got my peaches out in Georgia (Oh, yeah, shit)

I get the feeling, so I'm sure (Sure)
Hand in my hand because I'm yours, I can't
I can’t pretend, I can't ignore, you're right for me
Don't think you wanna know just where I've been, oh
Done bein' distracted
The one I need is right in my arms (Oh)
Your kisses taste the sweetest with mine
And I'll be right here with you 'til the end of time

Screaming at each other, screaming at each other

Like a tragedy, like a dark comedy
Laughing at each other, laughing at each other
Like, ""Oh, oh, oh,"" it isn't funny anymore

But I just couldn't break your heart
Like you did mine yesterday

Sometimes honesty is the worst policy
Happy ever after, happy ever after
Let it go, you never need to know
I don't wanna be picking up all of these
Tiny little pieces, tiny little pieces
Of your heart, won't do it anymore[Chorus]

I never lied until today

Threw my clothes out in the yard

Parting (English Ver.) Lyrics
[Chorus: Yonghoon]
Repeating collision in between you and me
When it fades away but you're already so far away
In just one day before the asteroid
Falls down to the earth, to say the words I haven’t said

Yonghoon & Dongmyeong

Gravity draws up slowly pulling me from the heavy ground
Looking at the falling sandglass telling me, now it's time to leave
Dark shadows falling down, I can feel it's hurting me so much
Close my eyes with you and let me leave my ears to you

The sky blooming night with the stars (Oh, deep in that sky)
The dusts stacked on stars breathe short of breath

Rеpeating collision in between you and me
Whеn it fades away but you’re already so far away
In just one day before the asteroid
Falls down to the earth, to say the words I haven't said
[Post-Chorus: Dongmyeong, 
CyA
]
I wanna fly high to the sky
Deep in the sky, who am I? It's a dilemma
I won't leave your stars
The dark end of the sky spreading out the goodbye[Verse 2: Dongmyeong]
Words are in my mind
Gotta tell you but I can't ever say to you
Somewhere in between our countless farewells
Keep our memories deep inside
Endless sounds keep ringing in my ears
The angels without wings shining divine sounds
[Pre-Chorus: CyA]
Somewhere down the galaxy
It's okay, this place
I can breathe, leave the worries and pain
The last whisper of the marionette
I will bury it here in the time and space
Until the end we are here
[Chorus: Yonghoon & Dongmyeong, 
Yonghoon

Repeating collision in between you and me
When it fades away but you're already so far away
In just one day before the asteroid
Falls down to the earth, to say the words I haven't said

Your touch, you’re the one
That will save me from burning 
(Don’t ever let me go)
Even at the end of the world
I will never let you go
The end getting close the moment
Coming up slowly
When they have all gone
I will find my light[Interlude: CyA]
Let me call you back again flowing time and space
Placing your name in my heart though it hurts me bad
A feeling of regrets, a dusky feeling, and unload
[Chorus: Yonghoon, 
Dongmyeong
, 
Dongmyeong & Yonghoon

Under the star, the little sized asteroid
If I go back in time,
 
if I can be your light once again
I promise you, every day and every night
I'll tell you all my truth without any lies (Yeah)

“Breathe In Breathe Out” sees Kanye West rap about his own superficiality in a light-hearted, self-aware fashion. This marks Ye’s first time featuring Atlanta rapper Ludacris, roughly a year after he produced…

[Chorus: Ludacris]
Yeah! Breathe in, breathe out
If you're iced up, pull your sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull your keys out
Girls go wild and pull your D's out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull a weave out
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull the piece out, niggas like, ""Peace out!""
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Golly, more of that bullshit ice rap
I gotta 'pologize to Mos and Kweli (Kweli)
But is it cool to rap about gold
If I told the world I copped it from Ghana and Mali? (Mali!)
First nigga with a Benz and a backpack
Ice chain, 
Carti
 lens, and a knapsack
Always said if I rapped, I'd say somethin' significant
But now, I'm rapping 'bout money, hoes, and rims again
And it's still about the Benjamins
Big-face hundreds and whatever other synonyms
Strippers named ""Cinnamon,""
 
more chips than Pentium
""What you gon' buy next?"" Whatever new trend it is
I'm tryna spend my stacks, and I'm so broke
I look back, like, ""Damn, was I on crack?""
I mean, twelve platinum chains—was I on that?
What the hell was wrong with me, dawg?
Sing along with me, y'all[Chorus: Ludacris]
Yeah! Breathe in, breathe out (
Ugh
)
If you're iced up, pull your sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull your keys out
Girls go wild and pull your D's 
out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull a weave out
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull the piece out, niggas like, ""Peace out!""
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Now, even though I went to college and dropped out of school quick
I always had a Ph.D: a pretty huge dick
Ladies tired of getting ripped off by guys like this
And giving head is like a whale that's using a toothpick
Well, I'm in the club for a limited time
Act now and get some action for a free-ninety-nine
Later on, I might charge for ménage
Heard her man was the boss of the floss
But she still want to toss me the drawers
And it ain't gon' cost me because
She my caddy 'cause she grab my golf balls in the club
And I'm still acting calm than a 
muh'
She asked, ""Can you drive me in the hundreds where my Altima was?""
While we drive, she tellin' me 'bout problems with her man
Baby, I fully understand; let me help you with a plan
While he tricking off, don't get no rich nigga
Give 
me
 some head—that'll really piss him off[Chorus: Ludacris]
Yeah! Breathe in, breathe out
If you're iced up, pull your sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull your keys out
Girls go wild and pull your D's out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull a weave out
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull the piece out, niggas like, ""Peace out!""
[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I blow past low-class niggas with no cash
In a four-dash-six, bitch, you can go ask
So when I go fast, po-po just laugh
Right until I run out of gas or 'til I go crash
Whatever comes first, I'm prepared for the worst
Whatever comes second, I'll be there with my weapon
Pulling up in the Lexuses, one on both hand
So I guess them GS'ses was ambidextrous
Could've sworn her breast-eses was sending me messages
""K, I need a free hand-mammogram
I got weed, drink, and a Handicam
All of which is legal in Amsterdam""
So, say my name like Candyman
And I'ma come and fix you up like the handyman
But if you don't need a fix, girl, you gotta leave
You can't take that all at one time—
you gotta breathe![Chorus: Ludacris]
Yeah! 
Breathe in, br
eathe o
ut
If you're iced up, pull your sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull your keys out
Girls go wild and pull your D's out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull a weave out
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull the piece out, niggas like ""Peace out!""
[Outro: Kanye West]

[Intro: 50 Cent]
New York City
You are now rockin'
With 50 Cent
You gotta love it
[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I just wanna chill and twist the lye
Catch stunts in my 7-45
You drive me crazy, shorty, I
Need to see you and feel you next to me
I provide everything you need, and I
Like your smile, I don't want to see you cry
Got some questions that I got to ask
And I hope you can come up with the answers, babe
[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
If I fell off tomorrow, would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good, would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
If I went back to a hooptie from a Benz
Would you poof and disappear like some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt, would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work, would you be down to ride?
I get out and peel a nigga cap, chill and drive
I'm askin' questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap 'cause I flip burgers at Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you're feelin' me?
In the bed, if I used my tongue, would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter, would you write back?
Now, we could have a little drink, you know, a nightcap
And we could go do what you like, I know you like that (Like that)[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Now would you leave me if your father found out I was thuggin'?
Do you believe me when I tell you, you the one I'm lovin'?
Are you mad 'cause I'm askin' you twenty-one questions?
Are you my soulmate? 'Cause if so, girl, you a blessing
Do you trust me enough to tell me your dreams?
I'm starin' at you, tryna figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down, would you say things to make me smile?
I'll treat you how you want to be treated, just teach me how
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see
And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
Would you believe me, or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?
We only humans, girl, we make mistakes
To make it up, I'll do whatever it take
I love you like a fat kid love cake
You know my style, I say anything to make you smile[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
[Outro: Nate Dogg]
Could you love me in a Bentley?
Could you love me on a bus?
I'll ask twenty-one questions and they all about us

When producer Dr. Dre worked with 50 Cent on his debut album, he stated that he did not want the song on the album. According to 50 Cent, ""Dre was, like, 'How you goin' to be gangsta this and that and then put this sappy love song on?'"" 50 Cent responded saying, ""I'm two people.

Bring Me Down Lyrics
A big ol' “fuck you” to the haters from Mr. West and Brandy.

Some of these lines from this were previously in a January 2004 freestyle with Tim Westwood.
[Produced by Kanye West and Jon Brion]
[Chorus: Brandy]
I always knew that one day
They'd try to bring me down (Dow-own)
Way down, way down (Way down, oh-ah)
Ooh, one day, they'd try to bring me down (Ooh-ooh-ooh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Always knew that one day (Always that)
They'd try to bring me dow-own
Way down
They'd try to bring me down
[Verse: Kanye West]
We goin' to Mass today, we have to pray
Besides what the pastor say
I have to say, since Pac passed away
Most you rappers don't even deserve a track from me
You see, if you ever wanted to ever be anything
There'd always be somebody that'll shoot down any dream
There'll always be haters, that's the way it is
Hater niggas marry hater bitches and have hater kids
But they gon' have to take my life 'fore they take my drive
'Cause when I was barely livin', that's what kept me alive
Just the thought that maybe it could be better than what we at at this time
Make it out of this grind, 'fore I'm out of my mind
And get some leeway on the ""He say, she say""
Your girl don't like me, how long has she been gay?
Spanish girls say, ""Yo, no hablo inglés""
And everybody want to run to me for their sing-le
It's funny how these wack niggas need my help
Wasn't around when I couldn't feed myself
Dawg, if I was you, I wouldn't feel myself
Dawg, if I was you, I'd kill myself
Made a mil' myself and I'm still myself (
Oh-oh-oh-oh
)
And I'mma look in the mirror if I need some help
 (
Down
)
Now I'll speak from the heart, y'all all frontin'
Everybody feel a way about K but at least y'all feel somethin' (Feel somethin', feel somethin')[Bridge: Brandy]
What you callin'?
I let all in for gettin' what some get will get ya
What kind of dream we found? (Yeah)
See, I'm often catchin' crosswinds (Now)
Forgettin' where the hell I met ya (Met ya)
And try to bring me down
[Chorus: Brandy]
I always knew that one day
They'd try to bring me down
Way down, way down (Way down, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Always knew that one day
They'd try to bring me down (Down-own)
Way down (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Always knew that one day (Always that-one day)
They'd try to bring me down (Oh yeah)
Way down
They'd try to bring me down

Back to December Lyrics

[Verse 1]
I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why
[Pre-Chorus]
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die
[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you sayin', ""I'm sorry for that night""
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time
[Verse 2]
These days, I haven't been sleeping
Stayin' up, playing back myself leavin'
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall[Pre-Chorus]
And then the cold came, the dark days
When fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye
[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you, sayin', ""I'm sorry for that night""
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
[Bridge]
I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinkin'
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So, if the chain is on your door, I understand
[Chorus]
But this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you, sayin', ""I'm sorry for that night""
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time[Outro]

""Back to December"" addresses a first for me, in that I've never apologized to someone in a song before. In the good, or bad, or the apology, the person I wrote the song for deserves this. This is about somebody who was incredible to me, just perfect to me in a relationship, and I was really careless with him, so these are the words that I would say to him -- that he deserves to hear."" <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Swift/_/Back+to+December"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Sunflower, Vol. 6 Lyrics
[Intro]
(rewolfnuS) Sunflower
[Verse 1]
Sunflower, my eyes
Want you more than a melody
Let me inside
Wish I could get to know you
Sunflowers sometimes
Keep it sweet in your memory
I was just tongue-tied
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna make you feel bad
But I've been trying hard not to talk to you

I couldn't want you any more
Kiss in the kitchen like it's a dance floor
I couldn't want you any more
Tonight (Tonight, tonight, tonight)
[Verse 2]
Wondering, headshake
Tired eyes are the death of me
Mouthful of toothpaste
Before I got to know you
I've got your face
Hung up high in the gallery
Out of this shade
Sunflower, sunflower[Verse 3]
Your flowers just died
Plant new seeds in the melody
Let me inside
I wanna get to know you
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna make you feel bad
But I've been trying hard not to act a fool
My sunflower (Sunflower, sunflower)
[Chorus]
I couldn't want you any more
Kiss in the kitchen like it's a dance floor
I couldn't want you any more
Tonight (Tonight, tonight, tonight)
I couldn't want you any more
Kids in the kitchen listen to dancehall
I couldn't want you any more
Tonight (Tonight, tonight, tonight)
[Verse 4]
Sunflower, my eyes
Want you more than a melody
Let me inside
Wish I could get to know you
Sunflowers just died
Keep it sweet in your memory
I'm still tongue-tied

Whatcha Doing Lyrics
[Intro]
Ooh, na-na-na
Ooh, na-na-na-na
[Verse 1]
After midnight
Me and my thoughts alone
There's a part of me that wants to steal your heart
And a part that tells me, ""Don't""
'Cause I'm no good at givin' up control
Are you worried that I might find somethin' wrong?
'Cause I'm worried that I won't
[Pre-Chorus]
But if control is my religion
Then I'm headin' for collision
Lost my 20/20 vision
Please
[Chorus]
Whatcha doin' to me, baby?
I'm scared to death that you might be the one to change me
You're in my head and now you're cloudin' my decisions
Got me headin' for collision
Whatcha doin' to me, baby?
Oh, whatcha doin'?[Verse 2]
In the future
I see you next to me
But I can't shake the feelin' that there's more to learn
In the time between
[Pre-Chorus]
But if control is my religion
Then I'm headin' for collision
Lost my 20/20 vision
Please
[Chorus]
Whatcha doin' to me, baby?
I'm scared to death that you might be the one to change me
You're in my head and now you're cloudin' my decisions
Got me headin' for collision
Whatcha doin' to me, baby?
Oh, whatcha doin' to me?

Ooh, na-na-na
Tell me what you're doin' to me
Ooh, na-na-na-na
Tell me what you're doin' to me
Ooh, na-na-na
Tell me what you're doin' to me
Ooh, na-na-na-na[Pre-Chorus]
If control is my religion
Then I'm headin' for collision
Lost my 20/20 vision
Please (Tell me what you're doin' to me)
If control is my religion
Then I'm headin' for collision
Lost my 20/20 vision
Please
[Chorus]
Whatcha doin' to me, baby?
I'm scared to death that you might be the one to change me
You're in my head and now you're cloudin' my decisions
Got me headin' for collision

[Verse 1]
If you take too long to hit me back
I can't promise you how I’ll react
But all I can say is at least I'll wait for you
Lately, I've been on a roller coaster
Tryna get a hold of my emotions
But all that I know is I need you close

I’ma scream and shout for what I love
Passionate, but I don't give no fucks
I admit that I'm a lil' messed up
But I can hide it when I'm all dressed up

Good at overthinking with my heart
How you even think it got this far, this far?

I can be needy, tell me how good it feels to be needed
I can be needy, so hard to please me
I know it feels so good to be needed

Old Friends Lyrics
[Verse 1]
It's like when you're makin' conversation
And you're tryin' not to scream
And you're tryin' not to tell 'em
You don't care what they mean
And you're really feelin' fragile
And you really can't get home
And you really feel abandoned
But you wanna be alone
[Chorus]
Old friends, they shine like diamonds
Old friends, you can always call
Old friends, Lord, you can't buy 'em
You know it's old friends, after all
[Verse 2]
And when the house is empty
And the lights begin to fade
And there's nothin' to protect you
Except thе window shade
And it's hard to put your finger
On the thing that scarеs you most
And you can't tell the difference
Between an angel and a ghost[Chorus]

Harry brings his agony to life…

[Verse 1]
I'm in my bed
And you're not here
And there's no one to blame but the drink in my wandering hands
Forget what I said
It's not what I meant
And I can't take it back, I can't unpack the baggage you left
[Chorus]
What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
[Verse 2]
You said you cared, and you missed me too
And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you
And the coffee's out at the Beachwood Cafe
And it kills me 'cause I know we've run out of things we can say
[Chorus]
What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'[Bridge]
And I get the feeling that you'll never need me again (Oh)
[Chorus]
What am I now? What am I now?
What if you're someone I just want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?

Styles and songwriter/producer Kid Harpoon first worked together on Styles' self-titled debut album (2017) on two songs: ""Carolina"" and ""Sweet Creature"". He would also become later the music director of Styles' first world solo tour. While working on his second album, Styles was seeing in the studio working on new music with Harpoon on 15 May 2019. While talking about Styles and the recording process of the album, Harpoon claimed: ""He's got this wise-beyond-his-years timelessness about him. That's why he went on a whole emotional exploration with these songs. He went through this breakup that had a big impact on him."" Harpoon then suggested Styles to write about his feelings towards it, saying:"" He had a whole emotional journey about her, this whole relationship. But I kept saying, 'The best way of dealing with it is to put it in these songs you're writing.'"" Regarding ""Falling"" in particular, he told: "" Harry lives round the corner from me in LA and one day he wanted a lift somewhere, so I popped up there and he was getting out of the shower. I started playing piano while I was waiting for him, he was singing and in an hour we had written 'Falling'."" The song was eventually released as the album's third single on 7 March 2020 to UK adult contemporary stations.

""Falling"" debuted at number 39 on the UK Singles Chart and later peaked at number 15, making it the fourth song from Fine Line to chart in the UK top 20. In November 2020, it received a platinum certification from the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for selling 600,000 units in the UK. In the US, ""Falling"" was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales of 1 million track-equivalent units. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Harry+Styles/_/Falling"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

I See You Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Roll in the bar, me and my crew
Their little plan to get me over you
They're hookin’ me up, yeah
Buyin’ me drinks with a thousand girls
There's just one thing
[Chorus]
I can't go anywhere, I can't do anything
No, I can't close my eyes without you in my dreams
You won't leave me alone, even though I know you're gone
I look around for someone new, but I see you
Jumpin’ up there with the band
Takin’ me by the hand
Hey boy, come dance with me
Stuck like a melody in my head
In the bed of my truck
By the light of the midnight moon
Baby, I see you
[Verse 2]
Don't know what you did, but you done it good
You don't know how bad that I wish I could
Delete you from my phone, find a girl and take her home
But there's just one thing wrong[Chorus]
I can't go anywhere, I can't do anything
No, I can't close my eyes without you in my dreams
You won't leave me alone, even though I know you're gone
I look around for someone new, but I see you
Jumpin’ up there with the band
Takin’ me by the hand
Hey boy, come dance with me
Stuck like a melody in my head
In the bed of my truck
By the light of the midnight moon
Baby, I see you
[Bridge]
Your lips, your eyes
Girl, since you told me goodbye
[Chorus]
I can't go anywhere, I can't do anything
No, I can't close my eyes without you in my dreams
You won't leave me alone, even though I know you're gone
I look around for someone new, but I see you

Takin’ me by the hand

I’m This Lyrics
Baby I just want to be free
Sometimes I don't want to believe
But oh baby baby when you cry
Oh baby baby when you cry
I don't know what it is
But I'll do anything
For you
Baby I just want you to see
Sometimes I don't want to be a part of you
But oh baby baby when you cry
Yes oh baby baby when you cry
I don't know what it is
You don't care what it is
I like
And sometimes the pain
Catches on
I worship the weight
And turn it into song
And who I am
Is not measured by
What I've become
But I know enough
I will make the same mistakes
'Cuz I don't know what it is
I don't care what it is
I'm thisBaby I think we should be freaks
Something I would never believe
But oh baby baby when you cry
Yes oh baby baby when you cry
I don't know what it is
I don't care what it is
I like
And sometimes the pain
Catches on
I worship the weight
And turn it into song
And who I am
Is not measured by
What I've become
But I know enough
I will make the same mistakes
Cos I don't know what it is
I don't care what it is

I might never be your knight in shinin' armour
I might never be the one you take home to mother
And I might never be the one who brings you flowers
But I can be the one, be the one tonight

I could tell that you were curious, oh, yeah

Then, baby, you're perfect
Baby, you're perfect
So let's start right now

I might never be the hands you put your heart in
Or the arms that hold you any time you want them
But that don't mean that we can't live here in the moment

Arkansas Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Took a Nine Eleven 'bout a hundred and seven down a back road
Where the white river runs
 and the southern sun makes the 
kudzu
 grow
And what I found in the Ozark mountains, I ain't ever seen
It sure does feel like you're sittin' on top of the world to me
[Chorus]
Gotta get down, gotta get down to Arkansas
Havin' so much fun that it's probably a little bit against the law
All the boys and the girls down there sure do know how to have a ball
If you wanna get down, gotta get down to Arkansas
[Instrumental]
[Verse 2]
Well, we burned through the one light towns like a scaldеd dog
When we lit out of Fayettеville, they were callin' the hogs
We made a pit stop in Little Rock for some barbecue
And when we hit West Memphis there were blue lights in our rear view
[Chorus]
Gotta get down, gotta get down to Arkansas
Havin' so much fun that it's probably a little bit against the law
All the boys and the girls down there sure do know how to have a ball
If you wanna get down, gotta get down to Arkansas[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Gotta get down, gotta get down to Arkansas
Havin' so much fun that it's probably a little bit against the law
All the boys and the girls down there sure do know how to have a ball
If you wanna get down, gotta get down to Arkansas
Gotta get down, gotta get down to Arkansas
Havin' so much fun that it's probably a little bit against the law

Let’s Get High Lyrics
This 2001 track details a comically messed-up party in which most of the attenders are heavily intoxicated or on drugs.
[Intro: Phish & crowd]
All these niggas and all these hoes in here, 
Somebody here gon' fuck!
All these niggas and all these hoes in here, 
Somebody here gon' fuck!
All these niggas and all these hoes in here, 
Somebody here gon' fuck!
All these niggas and all these hoes in here, 
Somebody here gon' fuck!
[Verse 1: Hittman]
Talking that, walking that, spittin' at hoes
Smoking this, drinking that, gettin' at hoes
Fuck this, I'm hitting that, I'm hitting 'em both
Have one riding dick, one licking my toes
When I'm loving these hoes there ain't no love involved
No hugs, no kisses, bear rugs, bare britches
Rare bitches, like them hoes in them 
Black Tail
 pictures
Bitch, jumped off my dick
(
""Is that Dre over there?""
)
[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Yeah, I just took some ecstasy
Ain't no telling what the side effects could be
All these fine bitches equal sex to me
Plus I got this bad bitch laying next to me
No doubt, sat back on the couch
Pants down, rubber on, set to turn that ass out
Laid the bitch out, then I put it in her mouth
Pulled out, nutted on a towel, and passed out[Hook: Kurupt & Traci Nelson]
Come on, let's get high (High)
Let's get high (High)
Come on, let's get high (High)
Let's get high, all my ladies
Let's get high (High)
High (High)
Let's get high (High)
Come on, let's get high
[Verse 3: Kurupt]
I make the '4 hop
Pull up at the spot
Weed by the barrels, in my G'd up apparel
Stomping in the party
Kurupt Young Gotti
I'm fucking something in this bitch
Hit 'em with some gangsta shit
Put something in your mouth, bitch – real tasty
I'm looking real saucy in my gangsta-ass Stacys
Hit the party, ease up, Kurupt with an ounce an'
Got all the hoes in this motherfucker bouncing
Bouncing
[Interlude: Mel-Man & 
Scruncho
]
Yo, whattup, Scruncho?
Mel-Man – what's cracking?
Wassup wit' all these ol' punk ass hoes in here?[Verse 4: Ms. Roq]
Nigga, what? I'm a hustling bitch, I like them get-rich niggas
Them hit-the-switch niggas
Niggas 'bout the sex, and which bitch to hit next
While I'm kicking my game and collecting them checks
Got all y'all niggas vexed to fuck this triple-X rated ho
You say you ain't eat it, you ate it though
And uh, Roq don't stop, can't be dropping no drawers
To the niggas, how you figure? Got you shitting in yours
Yeah, little dicks always running they mouth
While a bitch is better off to masturbate and be out
All you bitches up in here know what I'm talkin about
Get the loot, get the ice, fuck the wife, no doubt
Trying to live lavi', marry a big dick and stay cavi'
Holla back at them niggas that hollered at me
Pop the Cris' – whip the 6 and shit
And have all y'all niggas limp when I twist my shit
[Outro: Ms. Roq]
Yeah, bitch ass niggas",https://genius.com/Dr-dre-lets-get-high-lyrics,"",""

Company Lyrics
On “Company,” Bieber takes a step back from talking about his serious relationships—instead, he writes a lighter song about the joys of a casual hook-up.

 Posted by Justin on his Instagram page.
[Chorus]
Can we, we keep
Keep each other company?
Maybe we, can be
Be each other's company
Oh company
[Verse 1]
Let's end each other's lonely nights
Be each other's paradise
Need a picture for my frame
Someone to share my reign
Tell me what you wanna drink
I'll tell you what I got in mind
Oh, I don't know your name
But I feel like that's gonna change
[Pre-Chorus]
You ain't gotta be my lover
For you to call me baby
Never been about no pressure
Ain't that serious

Can we, we keep
Keep each other company? (Oh)
Maybe we, can be
Be each other's company
Oh company[Post-Chorus]
Oooooooooh
Oooooooooh
Oooooooooh
Oooooooooh
[Verse 2]
It ain't about the complications
I'm all about the elevation
We can keep it goin' up
Oh, don't miss out on us
Just wanna have a conversation
Forget about the obligations
Maybe we can stay in touch
Oh that ain't doin' too much
[Pre-Chorus]
You ain't gotta be my lover
For me to call you baby
Never been about no pressure
Ain't that serious, no

[Verse 1]
Our coming-of-age has come and gone
Suddenly, this summer, it's clear
I never had the courage of my convictions
As long as danger is near
And it's just around the corner, darlin'
'Cause it lives in me
No, I could never give you peace
[Chorus]
But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade, ocean wave blues come
All these people think love's for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
[Verse 2]
Your integrity makes me seem small
You paint dreamscapes on the wall
I talk shit with my friends, it's like I'm wasting your honor
And you know that I'd swing with you for the fences
Sit with you in the trenches
Give you my wild, give you a child
Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other
Family that I chose, now that I see your brother as my brother
Is it enough?
But there's robbers to the east, clowns to the west
I'd give you my sunshine, give you my best
But the rain is always gonna come if you're standin' with me[Chorus]
But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade, ocean wave blues come
All these people think love's for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?",https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-peace-lyrics,"""peace"" is the fifteenth track from Taylor Swift's eighth studio album ""folklore"".

It was released on July 24, 2020, through Republic Records. This song was confirmed on Taylor’s social media accounts on July 23, 2020.

“peace” is a calm tune describing Swift’s maturation and changing view of romance. Like August, 2019’s “The Archer,” Swift explains her shortcomings in a relationship and hopes that her partner will stay with her in spite of them. However, unlike her own personal flaws explored in “The Archer,” this song focuses on Swift’s fame — she worries that their lack of privacy could drive her partner away.

Swift spoke about the song in a November 2020 piece for Rolling Stone:

""""peace"" is actually more rooted in my personal life. [It comes after] carving out a human life within a public life, and how scary that can be when you do fall in love and you meet someone, especially if you’ve met someone who has a very grounded, normal way of living. I, oftentimes, in my anxieties, can control how I am as a person and how normal I act and rationalize things, but I cannot control if there are 20 photographers outside in the bushes and what they do and if they follow our car and if they interrupt our lives. I can’t control if there’s going to be a fake weird headline about us in the news tomorrow. […] I think that in knowing him and being in the relationship I am in now, I have definitely made decisions that have made my life feel more like a real life and less like just a storyline to be commented on in tabloids. Whether that’s deciding where to live, who to hang out with, when to not take a picture — the idea of privacy feels so strange to try to explain, but it’s really just trying to find bits of normalcy. That’s what that song “peace” is talking about. Like, would it be enough if I could never fully achieve the normalcy that we both crave?""

Dessner told Rolling Stone that it uses similar sonic elements to Swift’s December 2020 song “marjorie”:

""[‘marjorie’ is] a track that actually existed for a while, and you can hear elements of it behind the song ‘peace.’ This weird drone that you hear on ""peace"", if you pay attention to the bridge of ‘marjorie,’ you’ll hear a little bit of that in the distance.""

“peace” debuted at #58 on the Billboard Hot 100 during the chart week of August 8, 2020. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Swift/_/Peace"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."

[Intro]
Hoo
Niaga ti ta kcab er'uoy, loof
[Verse 1]
Boyfriends, they think you're so easy
They take you for granted
They don't know, they're just misunderstanding
[Refrain]
You
You, you're back at it again
[Verse 2]
Weakened when you get deep in
He starts secretly drinking
It gets hard to know what he's thinking
[Refrain]
You
Love a fool who knows just how to get under your skin
You
You, you still open the door
[Bridge]
You're no closer to him
Now you're halfway home
Only callin' you when
He don't wanna be alone
Oh, and you go
But why? You don't know[Verse 3]
Boyfriends, are they just pretending?
They don't tеll you where it's heading
And you know thе game's never ending
[Refrain]
You
You lay with him as you stay in the daydream
You
Feel a fool, you're back at it again
[Outro]

In the interview with Zane Lowe on Apple Music, Harry talked about working on the song:

""“Boyfriends” was written right at the end of ""Fine Line"". I fineshed the album and we touched on a last time, there was like an extra week growing to write some stuff […] we were recording “Lights Up” […] and at the end of that session everyone left, and I started writing “Boyfriends” and it almost felt like “Ok, there’s a version where we get this ready to put on [Fine Line]”, and I think there was something about that just felt like “It’s just gonna have its time, so like, let’s not rush to get it done.” And we did so many versions of it, you know, it was as like, vocal and acoustic, and then vocal and this with that, you know, electric guitar and then this and then that. […] We did the harmonies on everything […] and in the end it was like “Ok, we need, like, there’s something that it has to be, to be what it should be” and Ben Harper played on it, it’s his hands playing that guitar. And it’s like the guitar where he wrote his first three albums. And he’d gifted it to his daughter, and had to ask for it back to borrow to play it on the [song], but he didn’t tell her what it was for, so I believe now will be her finding out where he played it. But thank you for letting us borrow it. It was just like a singular moment I think for all us, we’re such big fan of him as well and it just fell like a really special moment.""

In the same interview, Harry told a little about the meaning of the song:

""I think the good part of [“Boyfriends”] is that it is everything. It’s both acknowledging my own behavior. It’s looking at behavior that I’ve witnessed. I grew up with a sister, so it’s watching her date people and watching friends date people, and people don’t treat each other very nicely sometimes. It was one of those really quick, just say what you think of boyfriends."" <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Harry+Styles/_/Boyfriends"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

[Intro: Protestor]
I'ma say this and I'ma end mine
If you ain't down for the Africans here in the United States
Period, point-blank
If you ain't down for the ones that suffered in South Africa from apartheid and shit
Dammit, you need to step your punk-ass to the side
And let us brothers and us Africans step in
And start puttin' some foot in that ass
[Bridge: All]
Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin'
Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin'
Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin'
Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin'
[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
I got my finger on the trigger, some niggas wonder why
But livin' in the city, it's do-or-die
I got my finger on the trigger, some niggas wonder why
But livin' in the city, it's do-or-die
[Verse 1: Daz Dillinger]
Dem wonder why mi violent, dem no really understand
For de reason why mi take mi law in mi own hand
Mi not out for peace and mi not Rodney King
De gun goes click, mi gun goes bang
Dem riot in Compton and dem riot in Long Beach
Dem riot in L.A. 'cause dem no really wanna see
Niggas start to loot and police start to shoot
Lock us down at seven o'clock, barricade us like Beirut
Mi don't show no love 'cause it's us against dem
Dem never, ever love me 'cause it's sport to break dem
And kill, at my own risk, if I may
To lay, to spray with my AK, and put 'em to rest[Interlude: Reporter]
Yeah, we have, there have been riots, ah, uh, rioting
Well, I don't wanna say rioting, but there's been looting downtown
But right now, Bree, what I want to show you is
They have started fires down at the end of the street
[Refrain: All & 
Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg
]
How many niggas are ready to loot?
Yeah, so what you wanna do?
 
What you wanna do?
I said, how many niggas are ready to loot?
Got myself an Uzi and my brother a 9
[Interlude: Interviewee]
That's what they told us today, ""In other words, you still a slave""
No matter how much money you got, you still ain't shit!
[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Sitting in my living room, calm and collected
Feeling that gotta-get-mine perspective
'Cause what I just heard broke me in half
And half the niggas I know, plus the niggas on the Row is bailing
Laugh now, but cry much later
You see, when niggas get together, they get mad 'cause they can't fade us
Like my niggas from South Central, Los Angeles
They found that they couldn't handle us
Bloods, Crips on the same squad
With the Ese's helpin', nigga, it's time to rob and mob
And break the white man off something lovely, biddy-bye-bye
I don't love dem so dem can't love me
Yo, straight puttin' it down, gettin' my scoot on
It's jumping off in Compton so I gots to get my loot on
And come up on me some furniture or somethin'
Got a VCR in the back of my car
That I ganked from the Slauson Swap Meet
And motherfuckers better not try to stop me
'Cause they will see that I can't be stopped
'Cause I'ma cock my Glock and pop 'til they all drop[Interlude: Reporter & 
Reporter 2
]
Yes, on the videotape we seem to have the, uh
People in the crowd throwing things at the officers
And swinging at them as well
As there was a, uh, young woman there, you see, took a swing at—
At an officer with some object in her hand
[Refrain: All & 
Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg
]
How many niggas are ready to loot?
Yeah, so what you wanna do? What you wanna do?
I said, how many niggas are ready to loot
?
Got myself an Uzi and my brother a nine

I got my finger on the trigger, some niggas wonder why
But livin' in the city, it's do-or-die
I got my finger on the trigger, some niggas wonder why
But livin' in the city, it's do-or-die
[Verse 3: RBX]
One-time trigger happy, no nigga love
One-eighty-seven time, time to grab the glove
Can't get prints on a nine I throw away
Or get prints on my Uzi when it spray
Pop-pop, pop, another motherfucker drop
And I get relief like, 
plop, plop, fizz
Smash, I crashed his head like a window
I ain't Nintendo
, 
I'm high off the indo
Creepin', with the quickness 
to the cut
Bust one to his head while he munches on a donut
And crack-up, so now he best to back up
I guess I gots to pack up, filling the clip up
I zip uptown but motherfuckin' cops are all around
Helicopters flyin', these motherfuckers tryin'
To catch me and stretch me on Death Row
But hell no, the poor blacks refuse to go[Interlude: Reporter 2]
This now covers a very, very wide area of Los Angeles where these fires have been, uh, ignited
I mean, from here to the, uh, to the south end of South Central is a long way
[Bridge: All]
Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin'
Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin'
Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin'
Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin'
[Verse 4: Daz Dillinger]
The outcome of this is destruction, so them all fall
Niggas don't give a fuck, so them bust and them fall
The description of three blacks
Shows no justice,
 so, pick up it's your right
If you riot again, mi, turn the other cheek
We, be too many, mi got, mi nine to my side
So mi bust, flick, 'cause he don't give a fuck
And mi don't give a fuck
And all my problems end with that buck-buck
[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Blam, blam, blam 'til dem fall
Listen to the shots from a nigga Doggy Dogg, biddy-bye
Dr. Dre, him bust gun shots
Diggidy Daz and RBX, dem bust gun shots

Beer in the Headlights Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Honey suckle in the air, breeze blowing through your hair
Hundred stars hanging high, under your still tide
Up in every move you make, baby I'm your DJ
You're my favorite song, won't you let me sing along
[Chorus]
Sittin' right here, out here in the middle of nowhere
I swear I've never seen, ever seen nothing like you anywhere

I'm turning it up and you're spinnin' around
Takin' a sip, swingin' your hips
Girl, you're looking so fine, with your beer in the headlights
[Verse 2]
Heart beating like a drum, call me the lucky one
Shining these Hi-Beams on you baby
Boots stiring up the dirt Cottonfield concert
You got the beautiful, I got the cooler full

I swear I've never seen, ever seen nothing like you anywhere

Rihanna also became the female artist to get twelve number one hits the fastest.

“You’re not sad or dancing. You’re happy and hippie. It’s laid-back, but it’s hopeful,” Rihanna told Elvis Duran. “It gives me such a great feeling when I listen to it. The lyrics are very hopeful and positive, but it’s about love and the gears are a little different from what people would expect. I’m excited to surprise them sonically.”

Ah, hey, yeah

I know I be on some bullshit
Know I be driving you crazy

So come here and give me some kisses

You know I'm very impatient
Might change my mind, so don't keep me waiting

The Beast Lyrics
[Intro]
Turn on the music
[Verse 1]
I touch your face 'cause I see panic, who rang the alarm?
I see you shiverin', your eyes are red, your soul is gone
You're out of breath, tick-tock, tick-tock, you're almost out of time, yeah, yeah
Because at midnight, there's a change in you that I have heard
You've kept this secret for so long, you whisper and it burns
You're out of breath, tick-tock, tick-tock, you're almost out of time, yeah, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
You can't hide who you are, 
11:59
Your heart's racin', you're growlin' and we both know why
Yeah, we both know why
[Chorus]
Turn on the music
Turn off the lights
I wanna feel the beast inside
I know you're hungry, ready to bite
I wanna watch you turn tonight
I wanna feel the beast inside
[Verse 2]
The girls are scared of you, a legend in your neighborhood
Last week, you left somebody dead, you're so misunderstood
You got your hands a little red, tick-tock, you're out of time, oh yeah, hoo[Pre-Chorus]
You can't hide who you are, 
11:59
Your heart's racin', you're growlin' and we both know why
Yeah, we both know why
[Chorus]
Turn on the music
Turn off the lights
I wanna feel the beast inside
I know you're hungry, ready to bite
I wanna watch you turn tonight
I wanna feel the beast inside

[Verse 1]
I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit
Been saying ""yes"" instead of ""no""
I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though
I hit the ground running each night
I hit the Sunday matinée
You know the greatest films of all time were never made
[Pre-Chorus]
I guess you never know, never know
And if you wanted me, you really should've showed
And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow
And it's alright now
[Chorus]
But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
(Ooh)
[Verse 2]
I have this dream you're doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own
You meet some woman on the internet and take her home
We never painted by the numbers, baby
But we were making it count
You know the greatest loves of all time are over now[Pre-Chorus]
I guess you never know, never know
And it's another day waking up alone
[Chorus]
But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
[Bridge]
I, I, I persist and resist the temptation to ask you
If one thing had been different
Would everything be different today?
[Chorus]
We were something, don't you think so?
Rosé flowing with your chosen family
And it would've been sweet
If it could've been me
In my defense, I have none
For digging up the grave another time
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one

I think that Rick [Genest] just was an inspiring person. And when I was working on this song, which is ultimately a big celebration song, that word just popped into my head.

Maria Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I've had love, but his is the deepest, yeah
Says he'll never leave, he means it too, yeah
Ooh, I owe it to you
He was cold and now he's the sweetest, yeah
'Cause he knows how much there is to lose, yeah
Ooh, I owe it to you
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I owe it to you
Ooh, I owe it to you
[Chorus]
Maria, I know you're gone
But I feel ya when we're alone
Even when I'm here in his arms
I know you're somewhere in his heart
[Post-Chorus]
Maria
Maria
I know you're somewhere in his heart
[Verse 2]
When love comes young, you take it for granted, yeah
Now he knows certain things you can't undo, no
Ooh, I owe it to you
Deepest effect always comes from a cause
I'm better too from the ones that I've lost
Now he is everything I'd ever want
I wanna thank you for all that you've done[Chorus]
Oh, Maria, I know you're gone
But I feel ya when we're alone
Even when I'm here in his arms
I know you're somewhere in his heart
[Post-Chorus]
Maria
Maria
I know you're somewhere in his heart
[Bridge]
Never thought I could feel this way
Grateful for all the love you gave
Here's to the lovers that make you change
Maria, Maria, Maria
[Chorus]
Maria, I know you're gone
But I feel ya when we're alone (When we're alone)
Even when I'm here in his arms
I know you're somewhere in his heart
Oh, Maria, I look in his eyes and I see ya
Time after time
Even when I'm here in his arms
I know you're somewhere in his heart",https://genius.com/Dua-lipa-maria-lyrics,"In “Maria,” Dua interprets the failure of past relationships as appreciative experiences whose effects will carry into new ones. This appreciation is extended to the ex of her new partner – Maria – who through similar shortcomings has shaped the partner they are today.

Dua first spoke about the song in an interview on the Zach Sang Show weeks before its release. She reiterated the song’s concept on Z100 New York.

""“Maria” is another interesting perspective of full personal maturing moment, because when you go through a breakup you’re like all right that person’s going to go and be so much better for someone else now. I feel like, whatever happened here, they’ve learned and they’re going to put it into action in the next relationship. I think everyone has done that for someone or someone has done that for them. With every relationship you grow and you become hopefully a better version of yourself from the experiences that you’ve had. So “Maria” is really about being grateful to the ex and being like thank you for doing that, because we all grow, we all learn and now I have this person who’s just like meant for me in this way."" — via Zach Sang Show <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Dua+Lipa/_/Maria"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

And I Love Her Lyrics
The Beatles began recording “And I Love Her” on 25 February, 1964. They recorded two takes that day, with a full electric line-up, but it was evidently not the sound they were after. The second take was later…

​gracias a la vida Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me dio dos luceros que cuando los abro
Perfecto distingo lo negro del blanco
Y en el alto cielo, su fondo estrellado
Y en las multitudes, el hombre que yo amo
[Verse 2]
Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado el oído que en todo su ancho
Cada noche y día, grillos y canarios
Martillos, turbinas, ladridos, chubascos
Y la voz tan tierna de mi bien amado
[Verse 3]
Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado el sonido y el abecedario
Con él, las palabras que pienso y declaro
Madre, amigo, hermano y luz alumbrando
La ruta del alma del que estoy amando
[Verse 4]
Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado la marcha de mis pies cansados
Con ellos anduve ciudades y charcos
Playas y desiertos, montañas y llanos
Y la casa tuya, tu calle y tu patio[Verse 5]
Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me dio el corazón que agita su marco
Cuando miro el fruto del cerebro humano
Cuando miro el bueno tan lejos del malo
Cuando miro el fondo de tus ojos claros
[Verse 6]
Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado la risa y me ha dado el llanto
Así yo distingo dicha de quebranto
Los dos materiales que forman mi canto
Y el canto de ustedes que es el mismo canto
Y el canto de todos que es mi propio canto

Love It Gone Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I know, I know it, baby
Sounds like your day's been crazy
I just wanna hold ya
All the weight that's on your shoulders
Anything that's wrong
Let me, let me love it gone
Come on and trust me, honey
I can turn those raindrops sunny
Let me untie that tangle
Put on that Kiss an Angel Good Mornin' song
Let me, let me love it gone
[Chorus]
Little barefoot dancing
Little kissing in the kitchen romancing
Got a whole lot of love that I've been saving
And a bottle of wine that's been waiting
Long time for a night like this
Whatever's wrong, check it off your list
Girl, I want, I want
I wanna get lost in your lipstick
Oh, baby, let me love it
Let me, let me love it
Let me, let me love it gone[Verse 2]
Why don't you slip into a little something off the secret menu
Kick back and let down your hair
Yeah, that one right there looks so damn good on
Let me, let me love it gone
[Chorus]
Little barefoot dancing
Little kissing in the kitchen romancing
Got a whole lot of love that I've been saving
And a bottle of wine that's been waiting
Long time for a night like this
Whatever's wrong, check it off your list
Girl, I want, I want
I wanna get lost in your lipstick
Oh, baby, let me love it
Let me, let me love it
Let me, let me love it gone
So long

This night looks good on you
Let me love it, let me, let me love it
And every little inch of you
Let me love it, let me, let me love it[Chorus]

Little kissing in the kitchen romancing
Got a whole lot of love that I've been saving
And a bottle of wine that's been waiting

Girl, I want, I want
I wanna get lost in your lipstick
Oh, baby, let me love it

In Real Life Lyrics
Written by Bleu and Lindsey Ray, Demi goes through the oh so common plight of realizing a relationship isn’t what she expected or wanted.
[Verse 1]
In real life, I'm waking up alone
It's one more night you didn't make it home
And one more time you won't pick up the phone
In real life, you never bring me flowers
When you're here, it's only for an hour
I'm getting used to being on my own
[Pre-Chorus]
Because in real life you're not what I thought
Real life, this isn't what I want
Guess things aren't always what they seem
[Chorus]
But in my dreams, I'm waking up to roses
Champagne kisses
And I know it's always, always gonna be, gonna be this way
In my dreams, you're standing right beside me
Two hearts finally colliding
Then I wake up and realize, realize
This is real life
[Post-Chorus]
Real life, this is real life
Real life, real life
Real life, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, oh
Real life[Verse 2]
In real life, it doesn't always work out
People fall in love and then they fall out
Hearts can break and never make a sound
[Pre-Chorus]
Because in real life you're not what I thought
Real life, this isn't what I want
Guess things aren't always what they seem
[Chorus]
But in my dreams, I'm waking up to roses
Champagne kisses
And I know it's always, always gonna be, gonna be this way
In my dreams, you're standing right beside me
Two hearts finally colliding
Then I wake up and realize, realize
This is real life
[Bridge]
Just when I thought this was all real life could be
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Somebody came along and made my dream reality
[Chorus]
And now in real life, I'm waking up to roses
Champagne kisses
And I know it's always, always gonna be, gonna be this way
In my dreams, he's standing right beside me
Two hearts finally colliding
When I wake up, I realize, realize

[Intro]
Na-na, da-da, da-da, da-da
Na-na, da-da, da-da, da-da
[Verse 1]
Flowers open when they feel the sunlight
Moonrise, tide change, right before our eyes
Aggressive but softly, you place your lips on my lips
We're each other's vice
Our feelings, they go deep, deeper than the touching
Deeper than the ocean, so we ain't never rushing through
Our days or our nights, ain't no repercussions
Never get enough, I'm only for your consumption
[Pre-Chorus]
Always rain the most in April
Every scale needs to be stable
Earth keeps spinnin' around, we're breathin'
So thankful
[Chorus]
My love for you's habitual, yeah (Oh, yeah)
Not for a moment, but forever
Know it sounds untraditional, oh yeah
Never ungrateful for it
That's how we both want it
Habitual
Can't nobody keep me like you
Call it unconventional
Our love is habitual, yeah[Refrain]
Na-na, da-da, da-da, da-da
Na-na, da-da, da-da, da-da
[Verse 2]
Just to think that we've been out here this whole time
Workin' through the seasons
Never crossed paths 'til we had a reason
Now let's fast-forward, look up
A whole new perspective for life
[Pre-Chorus]
Always rain the most in April
Every scale needs to be stable
Earth keeps spinnin' around, we're breathin'
So thankful
[Chorus]
My love for you's habitual, yeah (So habitual)
Not for a moment, but forever
Know it sounds untraditional, oh yeah (No)
Never ungrateful for it (Never ungrateful)
That's how we both want it (Oh)

Enchanted Lyrics
“Enchanted” details Taylor’s infatuation with Owl City’s Adam Young, who Taylor corresponded with via email for quite some time. When she finally met him in New York City, she was “wonderstruck” but worried… 
Read More
 
[Verse 1]
There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you
[Verse 2]
Your eyes whispered, ""Have we met?""
Across the room, your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you
[Chorus]
This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you
[Verse 3]
The lingering question kept me up
2AM, who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now, I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say
""Hey, it was enchanting to meet you""
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you[Chorus]
This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck,
 dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you
[Bridge]
This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the storyline ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you
Please, don't be in love with someone else
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you
Please, don't be in love with someone else (Ooh)
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you (Ooh, oh)
[Chorus]
This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
This night is flawless (Please, don't be in love with someone else)
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck (Please, don't have somebody waiting on you)
Dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever (Please, don't be in love with someone else)

From the story-like narration, to the romantic and magical adjectives used, to the absolutely whimsical melody – this song is the fairytale era personified.


Interestingly, this track was originally planned to lend its title to the album, too, until Taylor’s record label CEO Scott Borchetta recommended she title it something more mature.

We were at lunch, and she had played me a bunch of the new songs. I looked at her and I’m like, ‘Taylor, this record isn’t about fairy tales and high school anymore. That’s not where you’re at.

[Verse 1]
I'm still a fan even though I was salty
Hate to see you with some other broad, know you happy
Hate to see you happy if I'm not the one drivin'
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm so mature, I'm so mature
I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men
I don't want none, I just want you
If I can't have you, no one should
[Chorus]
I might
I might kill my ex, not the best idea
His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?
I might kill my ex, I still love him though
Rather be in jail than alone
[Verse 2]
I get the sense that it's a lost cause
I get the sense that you might really love her
This text gon' be evidence, this text is evidence
I tried to ration with you, no murders or crime of passion, but damn
You was out of reach
You was at the farmer's market with your perfect peach
Now I'm in the basement plannin' home invasion
Now you layin' face-down, got me singin' over a beat[Pre-Chorus]
I'm so mature, I'm so mature
I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men
I don't want none, I just want you
If I can't have you, no one will

I did it all for love (Love)
I did it all on no drugs (Drugs)
I did all of this sober
I did it all for us, oh
I did it all for love (Love)
I did all of this on no drugs (Drugs)
I did all of this sober
Don't you know I did it all for us? (I'm gon' kill your ass tonight)
[Chorus]
Oh, I just killed my ex (My ex, oops), not the best idea (Idea)

She realizes this isn't a wise plan and is struggling to accept that the relationship may not have been meant to be and has reached a point of no return. Ultimately, her angry feelings power her to a place of acceptance and she's able to find closure in the knowledge that at least she put forth her best effort.

The song gets its title from Kill Bill (2003–2004), a martial arts film duology that focuses on an assassin named the Bride and her quest to exact revenge on her ex-boyfriend through murder. Mirroring the films' plot, the song's lyrics discuss SZA's fantasy to kill an ex-boyfriend and his new girlfriend out of jealousy. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/SZA/_/Kill+Bill"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Go ahead, you can say it's my fault
If it still hurts at all
I thought one of these days you might call
When you were feelin' small

Would it be too hard to say goodbye?
I hope that it's enough to make you cry
Maybe that day, you won't hate me

Go ahead, you can say that I've changed
Just say it to my face
One drink and I'm back to that place (To that place)
The memories won't fade (Won't fade)

Overall, ""Hate Me"" is a song about regret and the desire for forgiveness. It portrays the pain that results from hurting someone important, and the longing for redemption that stems from that guilt. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Miley+Cyrus/_/Hate+Me"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

French Exit Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I don't wanna stay till the lights come on
I just can't relate to the words of this love song
What's it gonna take to right all the wrongs?
'Cause right now, I can't give you what you want
[Refrain]
Everybody's still dancin'
Everybody's holdin' hands and romancin'
Someone's gotta be the last one standin'
And I hate that I'm leaving you stranded
[Pre-Chorus]
But I gotta hit the road
But I gotta hit the road

It's not a broken heart if I don't break it
""Goodbye"" doesn't hurt if I don't say it
And I really hope you'll understand it
Only way to go is a French exit

filer à l'anglaise
French exit[Verse 2]

But right now, I can't give you what you want

[Intro]
Too late for us
We both dangerous
Movin' so close, we combust
Is it bad that I want more?
[Verse 1]
I been gone so long, I don't know where I'm going
You be on my phone, talkin' 'bout what's my problem?
Had to go alone to get it how I wanted
Had to be alone to figure out how I should be loved
And if it's just us, is that enough?
Is it bad that I want more?

Bust it like that booty too big and you need two hands
Bust it like you catchin' a body and you in 
G stance
Bust it like it's 
casual Friday
 and you herе to dance
Call bluff, I know what's up
Can't get enough
Is it bad that I want morе?[Chorus]

I want you to stretch it
Limit, want you to test it
I know I was born to roll
I gotta know

So done with you
Nobody hurt me like you do
Every time you break my heart, it feel new
Every time I fall apart, I call you
I just wanna be loved

Egmont, Op. 84 - Fünfter Akt: Musik, Melodram, Siegessymphonie [Grillparzer] Lyrics
ERZÄHLER:
Die Eiche stürzt im Wetterstrahl zusammen;
Da sinket auch die Rebe, deren Ranken
Den Stamm umgrünten, sterbend in den Flammen. –
O Clärchen! Treues Herz! Wie kannst du leben,
Wo blutge Henker deinen Freund verdammen? –
Noch sucht sie Hilfe; – will den Ruf erheben
Mit Manneskraft! Die Zarte will es wagen,
Des Aufruhrs Fahne selbst voranzutragen!
Umsonst ihr heißes Flehn! Ein starres Schrecken
Lähmt Arm und Herz der Bürger. Nur Bedauern
Kann der Verzweiflung Schreckensruf sich wecken;
Und unersteiglich sind des Kerkers Mauern.
Auf wird der Morgen nun die Bühne decken,
Wo Egmonts Mörder schon am Richtblock lauern! –
Still wird das Herz und bricht der Lebensmüden.
Aus ist die Zeit! – Sie sucht den ewgen Frieden. –
Musik: Clärchens Tod bezeichnend
Larghetto
ERZÄHLER (unter dem Larghetto):
Süße Blume! Bald gesunken,
Welkst du nicht am Freundesbusen!
Einsam bluten deine Wunden.
Müde, müde
Glimmt das Lämpchen. – Nun wirds stille! –
Friede, Friede,
Mit dem Geiste, mit der Hülle! –ERZÄHLER:
Hinweg aus diesem Todesdunkel strebt
Der bange Blick und suchet Trost und Licht.
Ach! wird er Licht und Trost im Kerker finden,
Wo Clärchens Freund der letzten Stunde harrt? –
Gesprochen ist das Urteil: »Wenn der Morgen
Den Himmel rötet, soll sein edles Blut
Den Boden seines Vaterslandes röten.«
Doch seht den Helden in der Todesnacht!
Dort muss, wer zagt, zu festem Mut erstarken.
Ist diese Wange bleich? Dies Auge starr?
Hat die Verzweiflung dieses Herz ergriffen?
Deckt diese hohe Stirne kalter Schweiß? –
Der recht gelebt – er weiß auch recht zu sterben.
Er sinnet ungebeugt den Wegen nach,
Die ihn des Schicksals ernste Hand geführt,
Bis aus der Nacht ein goldner Morgen dämmert.
Er denkt der Freunde – auch des letzten Freunds,
Den ihm noch jetzt ein wunderbar Geschick
In Albas Sohn geschenkt! – Der Jüngling kann
Den Großen, der als Muster ihm geleuchtet,
Nicht retten zwar – doch sich ihm ewig weihn,
Und dann den letzten Wunsch vom Herzen nehmen.Er ist erfüllt! – des Lebens Rechnung schließet
Sich freundlich ab. Ein männlich festes Hoffen,
Dass nicht umsonst sein Blut er nun vergießet,
Zeigt ihm des Paradieses Pforten offen.
Ein süßer Traum zu frohem Trost entsprießet
Dem letzten Schlummer. – Himmlisch übertroffen
Ist irdisches Verlangen in den Tönen,
Die ihn zum Sieg mit ewgem Lorbeer krönen.
Und Clärchen reicht den Kranz! – Vorangegangen,
Frei von der Erde Fesseln, darf die Treue
Im Sternenkleid der Freiheit strahlend prangen –
Dass sich der Bund auf ewig nun erneue,
Winkt ihm des Engels sehnendes Verlangen.
Süß wird der Tod, denn selig war die Weihe! –
O hört ihn selbst, wie er den Sieg errungen!
Blickt hin, wie sich der Held zum Licht erschwungen!
Melodram
Poco sustenuto
EGMONT (unter der Musik):
Süßer Schlaf, du kommst wie ein reines Glück, ungebeten, unerfleht, am willigsten, du lösest die Knoten der strengen Gedanken, vermischest alle Bilder der Freude und des Schmerzes; ungehindert fließt der Kreis innrer Harmonie, und, eingehüllt in gefälligen Wahnsinn, versinken wir und hören auf zu sein.
[EGMONT entschläft, die Musik begleitet seinen Schlummer]Poco sustenuto
[Am Anfange dieses Stücks erblickt man die Erscheinung, welche nach und nach aus den Wolken hervordringt.]
Poco vivace
Andante con moto
Allegro ma non troppo
Più Allegro
EGMONT:
Verschwunden ist der Kranz! – Du schönes Bild; das Licht des Tages hat dich verscheucht! Ja, sie warens, sie waren vereint, die beiden süßesten Freuden meines Herzens. Der himmlische Friede, von meiner Geliebten borgte er die Gestalt; das reizende Mädchen kleidet sich in des Freundes himmlisches Gewand. In einem ernsten Augenblick erschienen sie vereinigt, ernster als lieblich. Mit blutbefleckten Sohlen trat das Gebilde, für das ich wirkte und lebte, vor mir auf, die wehenden Falten des Saumes mit Blut befleckt. Es war mein Blut und vieler Edlen Blut. Nein, es war nicht umsonst vergossen! Schreitet durch! – die Siegesgöttin führt euch an! Und wie das Meer durch eure Dämme bricht, so brecht, so reißt den Wall zusammen und schwemmt ersäufend vom Grunde hinweg, was sich entgegenstemmte.
Trommeln
Horch, horch! Wie oft rief mich dieser Schall zum freien Schritt nach dem Felde des Streits und des Siegs. Wie munter traten die Gefährten auf der gefährlichen rühmlichen Bahn! – Auch ich schreite einem ehrenvollen Tode aus diesem Kerker entgegen; ich sterbe für das Höchste, für das ich lebte und focht, und dem ich mich jetzt leidend opfere.
Trommeln lauter
Ja, führt sie nur zusammen! Schließt eure Reihen, ihr schreckt mich nicht! Ich bin gewohnt, vor Speeren, gegen Speere zu stehen, und ringsumgeben von dem drohenden Tod das mutige Leben nun doppelt rasch zu fühlen. Dich schließt der Feind von allen Seiten ein! – Es blinken Schwerter; – Freunde, höhern Mut! – Im Rücken habt ihr Eltern, Weiber, Kinder! – Schützt eure Güter! Und euer Liebstes zu erretten, fallt freudig, wie ich euch ein Beispiel gebe.

this is me trying Lyrics
Much like Swift’s August 2019 track “Afterglow,” “this is me trying” sees her accepting fault for relationship issues and making an effort to repair them. Fear, alcohol, and a sense of failure and isolation…

[Verse 1]
I've been having a hard time adjusting
I had the shiniest wheels, now they're rusting
I didn't know if you'd care if I came back
I have a lot of regrets about that
Pulled the car off the road to the lookout
Could've followed my fears all the way down
And maybe I don't quite know what to say
But I'm here in your doorway
[Chorus]
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
[Verse 2]
They told me all of my cages were mental
So I got wasted like all my potential
And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad
I have a lot of regrets about that
I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere
Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here
Pouring out my heart to a stranger
But I didn't pour the whiskey
[Chorus]
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying[Post-Chorus]
At least I'm trying
[Bridge]
And it's hard to be at a party when I feel like an open wound
It's hard to be anywhere these days when all I want is you
You're a flashback in a film reel
 
on the one screen in my town
[Chorus]
And I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
(And maybe I don't quite know what to say)
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

Staring at the ceiling with you
Oh, you don't ever say too much
And you don't really read into
My melancholia

I been under scrutiny (Yeah, oh, yeah)
You handle it beautifully (Yeah, oh, yeah)
All this shit is new to me (Yeah, oh, yeah)

The lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal

No deal
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze

All they keep asking me (All they keep asking me)
Is if I'm gonna be your bride
The only kinda girl they see (Only kinda girl they see)

They're bringing up my history (Yeah, oh, yeah)
But you weren't even listening (Yeah, oh, yeah)
[Chorus]
I feel
The lavender haze creepin' up on me
Surreal
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s shit they want from me

That lavender haze

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Alls my life, I has to fight, nigga
Alls my life, I—
Hard times like, ""Yah""
Bad trips like, ""Yah""
Nazareth
I'm fucked up, homie, you fucked up
But if God got us, then we gon' be alright
[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, and when I wake up
I recognize you're looking at me for the pay cut
But homicide be looking at you from the face down
What MAC-11 even boom with the bass down?
Schemin', and let me tell you 'bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
Now tell my mama I love her, but this what I like, Lord knows
Twenty of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me
Reapin' everything I sow, so my karma comin' heavy
No preliminary hearings on my record
I'm a motherfuckin' gangster in silence for the record, uh
Tell the world I know it's too late
Boys and girls, I think I've gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before, nigga
When our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, ""Where do we go?"" Nigga
And we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street for sure, nigga
I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright
[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
What you want you, a house⁠? You, a car?
Forty acres and a mule? A piano, a guitar?
Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I can see the evil, I can tell it, I know it's illegal
I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero
Thinkin' of my partner, put the candy paintin' on the Regal
Diggin' in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you
Every day, my logic get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico, ah
I don't talk about it, be about it, every day, I sequel
If I got it, then you know you got it, Heaven, I can reach you
Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, my dog, that's all
Bick back and Chad, I trap the bag for y'all
I rap, I black on track, so rest assured
My rights, my wrongs, I write 'til I'm right with God[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before, nigga
When our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, ""Where do we go?"" Nigga
And we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street for sure, nigga
I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright
[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
[Outro: Kendrick Lamar & Thundercat]
I keep my head up high
I cross my heart and hope to die
Lovin' me is complicated
Too afraid of a lot of changes
I'm alright, and you're a favorite
Dark nights in my prayers[Poem: Kendrick Lamar]
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers",https://genius.com/Kendrick-lamar-alright-lyrics,"""Alright"" is a song by American rapper Kendrick Lamar, taken from his third studio album, To Pimp a Butterfly. Lyrically a festive song about hope amid personal struggles, it features uncredited vocals from the song's co-producer Pharrell Williams during the chorus.

Most music publications considered it among the best songs and videos of the year, highlighting their message in the social context of the time. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Kendrick+Lamar/_/Alright"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","""Alright"" is a song by American rapper Kendrick Lamar, taken from his third studio album, To Pimp a Butterfly. Lyrically a festive song about hope amid personal struggles, it features uncredited vocals from the song's co-producer Pharrell Williams during the chorus. ""Alright"" was released to radio stations as the album's fourth single on June 30, 2015. Most music publications considered it among the best songs and videos of the year, highlighting their message in the social context of the time. ""Alright"" received four nominations at the 58th Grammy Awards: Song of the Year, Best Music Video, Best Rap Performance and Best Rap Song, winning the latter two. It was also nominated for a MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year.

The song was associated with Black Lives Matter after several youth-led protests were heard chanting the chorus, with some publications such as Rolling Stone, People, and Complex calling ""Alright"" the ""unifying soundtrack"" of the movement. In 2019, it was named the best song of the 2010s by Pitchfork. It was performed by Lamar in the Super Bowl LVI halftime show on February 13, 2022.

After creating the beat, Pharrell Williams came up with a hook six months later, which inspired Lamar to find the right lyrics. The hook, ""We gon' be alright!"" allowed Lamar to use the symbolism inherent to spur the rest of the song's lyrics that eventually resonated with an entire movement. In an interview with MTV News, Lamar said it was inspired by his trip to South Africa, witnessing other people's problems in the country: ""their struggle was ten times harder."" The track opens with lines from Alice Walker's The Color Purple, ""Alls my life, I had to fight"". Lamar introduced the character ""Lucy"", who plays an essential role in the remainder of the album. According to the lyrics, as Lamar gets bigger so does Lucy: ""ain't a profit big enough to feed you"". At the end of the track, Lamar talks about his suicidal thoughts once in a hotel room ""I didn't wanna self-destruct... The evils of Lucy was all around me."" For music critics a ""celebration of being alive"", Lamar described ""Alright"" as message of hope. The song begins as a spoken-word treatise before exploding into a shapeshifting portrait of America that brings in jazz horns, skittering drum beats and Lamar's mellifluous rapping as he struggles with troubles and temptations. Musically, it features marching band propulsion and a jazz band's breezy reeds. For his sole production credit, Pharrell Williams, who made the track with Digi+Phonics' member Sounwave, sings the hook.

Lamar was spotted filming the song's music video on Treasure Island in San Francisco, California and atop a traffic light pole in Los Angeles, California. It was released on Lamar's Vevo page on June 30, 2015. The seven-minute-long clip, directed by Colin Tilley and The Little Homies, was filmed entirely in black-and-white.

The music video starts by showing shots of life in a neighborhood. A young African-American man is seen lying on the ground and Lamar begins speaking. Police and destruction flood the scene as the music starts, and Lamar begins rapping a new verse alongside his Black Hippy cohorts (ScHoolboy Q, Ab-Soul and Jay Rock), in a car carried by four police officers. During the video, Lamar flies through California, while his crew is throwing out money to everybody and dancers perform in the streets. At the end of the music video, Lamar stands on a lamppost and a policeman shoots him down. The rapper falls to the ground finishing his monologue from the beginning of the video, but ends the clip with a smile.

Pitchfork ranked it as the best music video of 2015, highlighting ""Lamar's own flight above the streets of L.A., his inner-city Icarus providing one of the most arresting – and liberating – images of the year."" Consequence of Sound listed the video at number one on its ""Top 5 Music Videos of 2015"", concluding ""The video works as a microcosm of the sad and wretched state of many cities: crooked cops, burning cars, abandoned buildings, and bleak backdrops of an urban sprawl. It's powerful, harrowing, bleak, and hopeful all at once."" Spin also listed the clip atop its ""The 25 Best Music Videos of 2015"".

Eric Ducker for Rolling Stone wrote ""Lamar emerges as a charismatic but vulnerable superhero, flying through the city and doing donuts in a parking lot as a kid gleefully sits shotgun,"" and also commended the director Colin Tilley's work, ""he creates a starker experience befitting one of the most ambitious albums by a major artist in recent history. Tilley rises to the challenge of matching Lamar's beautifully complex and conflicted vision."" The editor listed it at number six on his best music videos of 2015 article. Slant Magazine staff named it the 4th best video of the year. The music video received seven nominations at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards, including Video of the Year, Best Male Video and Best Direction, ultimately winning the latter. Furthermore, it received a nomination for Grammy Award for Best Music Video.

Kendrick Lamar made a cameo in a promo ad for ABC sitcom Black-ish. A minute-long clip was released featuring Lamar's song in a music video the show's Johnson kids create to become an ""overnight viral sensation."" The remainder of the promo ad moves into a music video setting where the Black-ish casts raps along to ""Alright"" while Lamar himself sits on the family couch munching on snacks.

On January 25, 2016, the Grammys released a promotional video where Compton residents rap along to ""Alright"" before Lamar joins them at the end.

This song was featured during the end credits of The First Purge.

""Alright"" contains additional vocals performed by Pharrell Williams, Candace Wakefield and Thundercat. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Kendrick+Lamar/_/Alright"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."

Consequences Lyrics
“Consequences” can be seen as the follow-up of the relationship portrayed in “Never Be The Same”:

[Verse 1]
Dirty tissues, trust issues
Glasses on the sink, they didn't fix you
Lonely pillows in a stranger's bed
Little voices in my head
Secret keeping, stop the bleeding
Lost a little weight because I wasn't eating
All the songs that I can't listen to, to tell the truth
[Chorus 1]
Loving you was young, and wild, and free
Loving you was cool, and hot, and sweet
Loving you was sunshine, safe and sound
A steady place to let down my defenses
But loving you had consequences
[Verse 2]
Hesitation, awkward conversation
Running on low expectation
Every siren that I was ignoring
I'm paying for it
[Chorus 1]
Loving you was young, and wild, and free
Loving you was cool, and hot, and sweet
Loving you was sunshine, safe and sound
A steady place to let down my defenses
But loving you had consequences[Bridge]
No, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Said, no, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Hey, yeah, no, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, mm
[Chorus 2]
Loving you was dumb, dark, and cheap
Loving you will still take shots at me
Found loving you was sunshine, but then it poured
And I lost so much more than my senses
'Cause loving you had consequences
[Outro]
Yeah, loving you",https://genius.com/Camila-cabello-consequences-lyrics,"",""

[Intro: Frank Ocean]
And the peaches and the mangos that you could sell for me
[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
What do you think my brain is made for?
Is it just a container for the mind?
This great grey matter
Sensei replied, ""What is your woman?
Is she just a container for the child?""
That soft pink matter
[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Cotton candy, Majin Buu, ooh, ooh, ooh
Close my eyes and fall into you, you, you
My God, she's giving me pleasure
Oh, no, no
[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
What if the sky and the stars are for show?
And the aliens are watching live
From the purple matter?
Sensei went quiet, then violent
And we sparred until we both grew tired
Nothin' mattered
[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Cotton candy, Majin Buu, oh, oh, oh
Dim the lights and fall into you, you, you
My God, giving me pleasure
Pleasure, pleasure, pleasure
Pleasure over matter[Interlude: André 3000]
Hey, hey
[Verse 3: André 3000]
Since you been gone, I been having withdrawals
You were such a habit to call
I ain't myself at all, had to tell myself, ""Nah
She better with some fella with a regular job""
I didn't wanna get her involved
By dinner, Mr. Benjamin was sittin' in awe
Hopped into my car, drove far
Far's too close,
 
and I remember my memory's no sharp
Butter knife, what a life, anyway
I'm building y'all a clock, stop, what am I, Hemingway?
She had the kind of body that would probably intimidate
Any of 'em that were un-southern, not me, cousin
If models are made for modelin'
Thick girls are made for cuddlin'
Switch worlds and we can huddle then
Who needs another friend? I need to hold your hand
You'd need no other man, we'd flee to other lands
[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
Grey matter
Blue used to be my favorite color
Now I ain't got no choice
Blue matter[Outro: André 3000]
You're good at being bad (Ooh, yeah)
You're bad at being good (Ah-ha, oh)
For heaven's sakes, go to hell (Ah-ha)
Knock, knock on wood, hey (Ah-ha-ah)
You're good at being bad (You're bad at being good)
You're bad at being good (For heaven's sakes, go to hell, knock on wood)
For heaven's sakes, go to hell (Would have ya)
Knock, knock, knock, knock on wood
Well, frankly, when that ocean so mu'fuckin' good
Make her swab the mu'fuckin' wood
Make her walk the mu'fucking plank
Make her rob a mu'fucking bank

At Your Worst Lyrics
[Intro]
Ah, ah, mmm
[Verse 1]
I taught myself to cry on cue
I close my eyes and think of you
It's not that hard for me to do
'Cause everythin' leads back to you
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I know you got your reasons
You got your demons
[Chorus]
But I hope I never hate myself
The way I know you hate yourself
It hurts to see you hurt
The ones who love you at your worst
I'm sorry you don't trust yourself
Enough to trust somebody else
It hurts to see you hurt
The only ones who love you at your worst
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh[Verse 2]
I know it's sad (I know it's sad)
I miss you too (I miss you too)
You're turnin' red (You're turnin' red)
Oh, this isn't like you
But it's no excuse for all the times
You broke my heart and made mе cry
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I know you got your reasons (I know)
You got your demons (Your demons)
[Chorus]
But I hopе I never hate myself
The way I know you hate yourself
It hurts to see you hurt
The ones who love you at your worst
I'm sorry you don't trust yourself
Enough to trust somebody else
It hurts to see you hurt
The only ones who love you at your worst
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
[Chorus]
But sometimes I still hate myself
The way you made me hate myself
It hurts to know I hurt
The ones who love me at my worst
I'm sorry I don't trust myself
Enough to trust somebody else
It hurts to know I hurt
The only ones who love me at my worst",https://genius.com/Madison-beer-at-your-worst-lyrics,"“At Your Worst” is track 8 on the sophomore album Silence Between Songs by Madison Beer. While answering questions on Twitter, Beer replied that the song is “probably a 10/10”. Additionally, she stated “for me personally writing it that’s where i was – very special song to me”.

The track is about someone who is self-destructive and hurts the people who are most loyal to them. The song is most likely about Beer’s dad, Robert Beer. In the outro Beer realises she is like her father, but she dosen’t love that feeling. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Madison+Beer/_/At+Your+Worst"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","“At Your Worst” is track 8 on the sophomore album Silence Between Songs by Madison Beer.

[Chorus]
You showed me how to do
Exactly what you do
How I fell in love with you
You walk into a room
And people fall for you
How I wanna be like you
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh, it's true
I'm gonna be like you

Everybody laughs at all the things you say
It makes me wanna cry whenever you're away
The way you drive a car with all the windows down
They always say your name even when you're not around
[Pre-Chorus]
Seasons only change
It's always been the same
[Chorus]
You showed me how to do
Exactly what you do
How I fell in love with you
You walk into a room
And people fall for you

Oh, oh-oh, it's true
I'm gonna be likе you

I will be your fool, I come back evеry time
You always tell the truth even when you lie
I watch you from afar, you show me what to do
And all the games you play, now I play all of them too

Seasons only change
It's always been the same

She likes to watch him out the window
Goin’ ‘round in circles under the sun
Somethin’ ‘bout a man on a tractor
With his hat on backwards
Lookin’ forward to after he’s done

He keeps his eye on the back porch
She walks out, kicks off her shoes
Bare feet standin’ in the short grass
Sweet ice tea in a tall glass
Judgin’ by her smile, it’s about time to

Shut it down
Lotta work left to do, the sun’s still out
But any hay to make can wait for now
Throttle back, drop the plow
Shut it down

He wipes his face off with his t-shirt
Climbs down and meets her by the gate
Takes himself a long, cool sip
Lays some sugar on her lips
Thinkin’ maybe he oughta just call it a day[Chorus]
Shut it down
Lotta work left to do, the sun’s still out
Any hay to make can wait for now
Take it on in the house
Shut it down

Ooh, big, blue sky, half-plowed field
Bird on a fender, tractor sittin’ still

Fifteen Lyrics
In “Fifteen,” Taylor looks back at her freshman year at Hendersonville High. Taylor wrote the song about her best friend, Abigail Anderson, who she met during ninth grade and is still best friends with.
[Verse 1]
You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the mornin' of your very first day
You say ""hi"" to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
""You know, I haven't seen you around before""
[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
Fifteen
[Verse 2]
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough, you're best friends
Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can
And then, you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feelin' like flyin'
And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin 'round
But in your life, you'll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen
[Bridge]
When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had
To a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried
[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
I've found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be
At fifteen[Post-Chorus]
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la
[Outro]
Your very first day
Take a deep breath, girl
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors",https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-fifteen-lyrics,"According to  Songfacts,  Fifteen is about Taylor Swift's best friend Abigail.

Black-and-white film camera
Yellow sunglasses
Ash tray, swimming pool

Passports in foot wells
Kiss her and don't tells
Wine glass, puff pass
Tea with cyborgs
Riot America
Science and edibles
Life hacks going viral in the bathroom
Cocaine, side boob
Choke her with a sea view
Toothache, bad move
Just act normal
Moka pot Monday
It's all good

[Intro]
Nobody likes me
Nobody likes me, but that's okay
'Cause I don't like y'all anyway
Man, I don't like y'all anyway
Fuck all y'all
I let my watch talk for me, my whip talk for me
My gat talk for me, baow, what up, homie?
Them bitches who don't know me, they wanna blow me
'Cause the shit I floss with be saying a lot for me
[Verse 1]
I came in the rap humble, I don't give a fuck now
I'll serve anybody like niggas who hustle uptown (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Coke price go up, capsules come down
The D's run in my crib, I'm nowhere to be found
Niggas who hustle for me, they don't even stash tracks
They keep 'em on 'em, right there in they ass crack (Yeah)
When I don't like a nigga, I don't pretend to
I'll have the paramedics wrapping your fucking head like a Hindu
Look, I ain't going nowhere, so get used to me
OGs look at me and see I'm what they used to be
I'm that nigga that sold coke, the nigga that sold dope
The nigga that shot dice, went broke, then sold soap
The thug that pop shit, the thug that pop clips
The thug that went from three and a half to a whole brick
Nigga ain't in his right mind going against me
My pictures painted through words, I make a blind man see (Woo)[Chorus]
Scream, ""Murda,"" I don't believe you
""Murda,"" fuck around and leave you
""Murda,"" I don't believe you
""Murda, murda,"" your life's on the line
[Post-Chorus]
Y'all niggas don't want no parts of me
You tryna figure out how y'all started me
You gon' make me catch you on a late night
Pop shots with the fifth, then slide off in the six
[Verse 2]
I'm not a marksman while sparking, so I spray random
Not a pretty nigga, but my moms think I'm handsome
I hate to hear he say, she say shit
Unless he say she said she on my dick
It's no coincidence niggas who fuck with me get shot up (Blatt)
I do it Cali style, drive by and tear your block up
You soft, duke, you putting up a crazy front
I stay with the MAC 'cause niggas tried to blaze me once
In the hood, they like, ""Damn, 50 really spit it on 'em""
""You heard that shit?"" ""Yeah, 50 really shitted on 'em""
Beef, you don't want none, so don't start none
You're just a small player in this game, play your part, son[Chorus]
Scream, ""Murda,"" I don't believe you
""Murda,"" fuck around and leave you
""Murda,"" I don't believe you
""Murda, murda,"" your life's on the line
[Verse 3]
These cats always escape reality when they rhyme (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
That's why they write about bricks and only dealt with dimes (Yeah)
Leave it to them, and they say they got a fast car
NASCAR, truck with a crash bar
And TVs in the dash, pa
See 'em in the five with stock rims (Hahaha), I just laugh, pa
I catch stunts when I ain't trying, I ain't lying
I sip Dom P 'til I spit up, keep my wrist lit up
Get outta line, I get you hit up (Woo)
Now if you say my name in your rhyme, you better watch what you say
You get carried away, you could get shot and carried away
Now here's a list of MCs that could kill you in eight bars
50, um, JAY-Z and Nas
I'ma say this shit now and never again
We ain't buddies, we ain't partners, and we damn sure ain't friends
The games you playing, you get killed like that
Acting like you all hard, you ain't built like that
See me when you see me, nigga, what?[Chorus]
Scream, ""Murda,"" I don't believe you
""Murda,"" fuck around and leave you
""Murda,"" I don't believe you
""Murda, murda,"" your life's on the line

Gotta Make It To Heaven Lyrics
In this song, 50 Cent spits general verses of the struggles of his life, telling people not to mess with him, talking about how he’s the boss of the streets always having someone to do his dirty work.
[Intro]
Uh
Yeah
[Chorus]
I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell
I gotta make it to Heaven, I gotta make it to Heaven
I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell
I gotta make it to Heaven, I hope I make it to Heaven
[Verse 1]
Some say I'm paranoid, I say I'm careful how I choose my friends
I been to ICU once, I ain't going again
First Z got murked, then Roy got murked
And homie still in the hood, why he ain't getting hurt?
I smell somethin' fishy, man, it might be a rat
Damn, niggas switching sides on niggas just like that
You know me, I stay with a bitch on her knees
And give guns away in the hood like it's government cheese
Spray off Suzukis, eleven hundred CC's
No plate on the back
, 
straight squeezing the MAC
In the hood, they identify niggas by they cars
So I switch up whips to stay off the radar
I ain't gotta be around to make shit hot
I'll send Yayo to dump thirty shots on your block
You should spray that TEC, nigga, if I say, get it done
I'll make you wet niggas if you 'round me, son[Chorus]
I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell
I gotta make it to Heaven, I gotta make it to Heaven
I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell
I gotta make it to Heaven, I hope I make it to Heaven
I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell
I gotta make it to Heaven, I gotta make it to Heaven
I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell
I gotta make it to Heaven, I hope I make it to Heaven
[Verse 2]
When I come through the hood, I don't stop to rap to niggas (Yeah)
Get close enough to smack ya, then clap ya, nigga
Pop tried to front, so I waved the chrome on his ass
Point-blank range, I spazzed, pulled a bone on his ass (Woo)
Two weeks later, niggas came through with MACs to lay me down
They sprayed, I played dead and got the fuck off the ground
Out the blue, I get a phone call, ""50, what up?""
""They sent a bitch at me, I sent the bitch back cut up""
I don't play that pussy shit, I done told you, boy
Front on me, you gon' meet one of my soldiers, boy
Cousin Twin shot up his mama crib, now he in jail
Tripping off flicks of Blu Cantrell, pussy, and black tail
Pop mama moved, but she don't talk to him no more
The shells from Twin's four-four
 blew the hinge off her door
Without that check every month, how she gon' pay for the crib?
Man, social service finna come and take them kids[Chorus]
I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell
I gotta make it to Heaven, I gotta make it to Heaven
I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell
I gotta make it to Heaven, I hope I make it to Heaven
I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell
I gotta make it to Heaven, I gotta make it to Heaven
I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell
I gotta make it to Heaven, I hope I make it to Heaven
[Verse 3]
Lord, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change
The courage to change the things I can, the wisdom to know the difference (Yeah)
In AA, they make you say that
That's the prayer they burn in your head when you in CASAT (Woo)
Man, I might talk to you while we up in them pens (Uh-huh)
But when we come home, that don't mean we gon' fucking be friends
The shells pass your head close enough to hear 'em whistle
Thank God they missed you and go grab your pistol
In the hood, niggas running 'round acting crazy (Uh-huh)
Buying little Air Jordans for maybe babies
See, it might be his and it might be yours
'Cause them broads in the projects is straight up whores (Haha)
Man, it don't take much for you to get in them drawers (Uh-huh)
You can have 'em on they back or on all fours
You ain't got to tell me you feeling this shit
'Cause I hear what I'm saying, I know I'm killing this shit[Chorus]
I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell
I gotta make it to Heaven, I gotta make it to Heaven
I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell
I gotta make it to Heaven, I hope I make it to Heaven
I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell

[Intro: Swae Lee]
Unreal, what is this?
God done gave me strength
Are these the front row seats you wanted?
We'll have our final moment
[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
A walk-in attraction
A walkin' distraction
I'm naturally Black and
Unnaturally breathin'
Like a waist that is snatchin'
Welcome to my world where it's packed in
At the top of the tavern
How I see when this happenin'
All the real have been dabbed in
All the, all the bumps and the grabbin'
Ain't no cops here harassin'
All the looks and the laughin'
And outside, it got traffic
'Cause inside, we wreak havoc
Yеah, I know when this
Yeah, I know when this drastic, whеre it's goin'
When I back up emotions
All this here, I'm controllin'
When I'm back in the
When I'm back in the streets, on my side, I'm patrollin'
When I'm back in the, when I'm back in the (
Ah
)[Interlude: The Weeknd & 
Travis Scott
]
I know our love is forsaken (
Woo
)
But do you care if I was alive? (
Whenever I'm back in the
, 
ah
)
Or do you wanna be famous? (
Woo
, 
yeah
)
[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
I took the top off
Like she took her lil' blouse off
Too hard to go drop off
You know that boy not soft
I never would travel
So I need me a time vault
I been up in Cabo
With my Bailey Osanto
In this world, look around, yo
It's just mano y mano
I might still eat McDonald's
But don't think I'm a Ronald
I went back to my land
Move like Moses, walkin' over seas
In my state because the country
Every part of it is part of me
Tell your parliament, ""Pardon me"" (Woo)
Off the saké, turned to Socrates (Woo)
Heavy moments on the ground
Feel it shapin' in the sound
'Cause we ri—, 'cause we right in yo' house
And you know that we down
If yo' ass don't know nothin'
Gotta know that it's time
I'm excited to jump in
So much that I'm flyin'
Put you right in the function
Took you right off a vine
Got this shit in a bind
We got it, we got it now (
Ah, woo
)
Whenever I'm duckin' it (
Ah, woo
)[Outro: The Weeknd]
I'm waiting on a let go
I'm waiting on a let go
I know myself, I know exactly how to make you special
Go, collect your fame
I'm waiting in an echo
I'm waiting in an echo
'Cause you keep callin' back, I thought I told you that we do not
Sorry, I didn't let you out
Out, woah-oh

[Verse 1]
Somethin' must've gone wrong in my brain
Got your chemicals all in my veins
Feelin' all the highs, feelin' all the pain
Let go of the wheel, that's the bullet lane
Now I'm seein' red, not thinkin' straight
Blurrin' all the lines, you intoxicate me

Just like nicotine, heroin, morphine
Suddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need
All I need
Yeah, you're all I need
[Chorus]
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never be the same
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never ever, ever be the same[Post-Chorus]
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same

Sneakin' in L.A. when the lights are low
Off of one touch, I could overdose
You said, ""Stop playin' it safe
Girl, I wanna see you lose control""

Suddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need
All I need

When You’re Ready Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Maybe I had too many drinks, but that's just what I needed
I hope that you don't think that what I'm saying sounds conceited
When I look across the room and you're staring right back at me
Like somebody told a joke and we're the only ones laughin'
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't know why I try 'cause ain't nobody like you
Familiar disappointment every single time I do
And every single night my arms are not around you
My mind's still wrapped around you
[Chorus]
Baby, tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin'
Baby, any time you're ready
I'm waitin'
Even ten years from now, if you haven't found somebody
I promise I'll be around
Tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin'
[Verse 2]
What if my dad is right when he says that you're the one
No, I can't even argue, I won't even fight him on it
Call you when it's late and I know that you're in bed
'Cause I'm three hours back, seems like you're always six ahead[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't know why I try 'cause ain't nobody like you
Familiar disappointment every single time I do
And every single night my arms are not around you
My mind's still wrapped around you
[Chorus]
Baby, tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin'
Baby, any time you're ready
I'm waitin'
Even ten years from now, if you haven't found somebody
I promise I'll be around
Tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin', yeah
[Bridge]
And if I have to, I'll wait forever
Say the word and I'll change my plans
Yeah, you know that we fit together
I know your heart like the back of my hand

So baby, tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin'
Baby, any time you're ready

I'm waitin', yeah

Get In My Car Lyrics
Track 9 on 50’s 2nd album, The Massacre.

Oh how times have changed…
[Intro]
Uh-huh
Yeah
Uh-huh
Yeah
[Verse 1]
I'm a straight gorilla with it, cold-hearted killer with it
Any nigga gettin' outta line can get it (Yeah)
I make it hot, motherfuckers freeze up when I come through
Mac-10, 32-shot clip in my snorkel (Uh-huh)
I might smile and say, ""What's up?"" but I don't fuck with you niggas
My rap money slow up, I'll run up on you niggas (Woo)
I'm on the edge, I'm just waiting on a nigga to push me
Put my hand on my strap—what you looking at, pussy?
We ain't buddies, we ain't partners and we damn sure ain't friends
So much chrome on my Benz, you see your face in my rims
If your bitch wanna roll, I'ma let her get in
I don't play, but I'm a playa 'til the motherfucking end
[Chorus]
I got no pickup lines, 
I stay on the grind
 (Uh-huh)
I tell the hoes all the time, 
bitch get in my car (Bitch get in)
I got my 64, riding on Dayton spokes (Hahaha)
And when I open that door, 
bitch get in my car
I got no pickup lines, 
I stay on the grind
 (Uh-huh)
I tell the hoes all the time, 
bitch get in my car (Bitch get in)
I got my 64, ridin' on Dayton spokes (Hahahaha)
And when I open that door, 
bitch get in my car[Verse 2]
Don't tell me you don't know that, ah—I'm the shit
Now, you better watch your girl, man, I leave with your bitch
I ain't stunting these hoes, man, I'm 'bout my paper
If your bitch really 'bout it, nigga, I'm gon' take her
Backseat of my Jeep, fuck 'til I fuck up her makeup (Uh-huh)
Take her to the Diamond District, introduce her to Jacob (Woo)
Tell her if she like me, she should keep me icy
My game fuck with a bitch brain 'til she think she wifey (Yeah)
Spent her life savings in a day, 'cause she likes me
Committment from me, uhh... nah, not likely
Went out with Vivica, I thought
I was onto something
But then the next week, nah
Man, it was nothing (Hahaha)
[Chorus]
I got no pickup lines, 
I stay on the grind
I tell the hoes all the time, 
bitch get in my car (Bitch get in)
I got my 64, riding on Dayton spokes
And when I open that door, 
bitch get in my car (Hahaha)
I got no pickup lines, 
I stay on the grind
 (Uh-huh)
I tell the hoes all the time, 
bitch get in my car (Bitch get in)
I got my 64, riding on Dayton spokes
And when I open that door, 
bitch get in my car (Hahaha)[Verse 3]
Look into the windows of my soul, the eyes never lie (Uh-huh)
They blood shot red, it's ganja in my system, I'm high
First it's pain when you lust for love; then, it's smooth and calm
Feel the rush, like a needle's in your arm (Uh-huh)
It's a cold world, baby girl, loving me is not enough
Find out when you fucking broke, love won't get you on the bus (Yeah)
Man, you should see the pretty bitches that be sexing me
They suck cock; to make 'em hot, I just let 'em stand next to me (Woo)
Hundred percent thug, freak, too, I'll taste your love
69's the position, your mouth's full, baby, huh?
My conversation's so deep, I get in your head
Next thing you know, you yawning, turning over, and I'm in your bed
[Chorus]
I got no pickup lines, 
I stay on the grind
I tell the hoes all the time, 
bitch get in my car (Bitch get in)
I got my 64, riding on Dayton spokes (Hahaha)

TRAUMA (English Ver.) Lyrics
[Intro: CyA]
I wanna soothe my heart
The day I fell right into the sea reach out your hand
Come now, and save
More and more getting worse now, got me wrapped in trauma
[Refrain: CyA, 
CyA & Yonghoon

Under the water, one of you probably
Let's now be honest
And deep in the ocean, despairing, bearing
I'm all jumbled up now, I'm trapped in the 
aquarium

Yonghoon
]
Take me back to my place
You're all over my mind, take me out before it's too late
Get out
I knew things will end up likе this, got me wrapped in trauma
I know the еnd is near, but my heart's reaching out
Deeper and deeper into you like gravity
I can't control myself
But there is no way

CyA and & Yonghoon

The fishes turn their back up against
Even they are against, turning, turning on me
Aquarium
I can never escape from you
You make me fall in distorting
[Verse 2: CyA]
Feeling of being stung and skin being ripped out
Is there a reason? Look for parts in a person
Silhouette was that a pretty pearl, treasure
Was it a painful dagger, multi-personality?
Black and dark, all over filthy
And memories on the scars all over me
Who're you blaming? Why do you care?
You should keep it, stay
I'll just keep on doing what I want

[Bridge: Yonghoon]
I can feel the dark silence
At the end of the foggy sea
A place where I cannot see from here
I feel like you will answer me from there
I have nothing else to lose anymore
It's enough I have lost you once before
I don't even have the strength to stand up
Don't ever let go, never, yeah

[Verse 1]
I found the truth beneath your lies
And true love never has to hide
True love never has to hide
I'll trade your broken wings for mine
Trade your broken wings for mine
I've seen your scars and kissed your crime, oh
Seen your scars and kissed your crime
[Pre-Chorus]
So many people that I know, they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
Give you some time to prove that I can trust you again
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
[Chorus]
All night long
Love all night long
Sweet love all night long
Sweet love all night long
All I wanna, ain't no other
We together, I remember
Sweet love all night long[Verse 2]
Our love was stronger than your pride
Beyond your darkness, I'm your light, oh
If you get deep, you touch my mind
If you get deep, you touch my mind
Baptize your tears and dry your eyes, oh
Baptize your tears and dry your eyes
[Pre-Chorus]
So many people, I know that they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up

They say true love's the greatest weapon
To win the war caused by pain, pain
But every diamond has imperfections
But my love's too pure to watch it chip away
Boy, nothing real can be threatened
True love breathes salvation back into me
With every tear came redemption
And my torturer became my remedy[Pre-Chorus]
So many people, I know that they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
Give you some time to prove that I can trust you again

It ain't rainin' anymore
It's hard to breathe when all you know is
The struggle of stayin' above the risin' water line

I was just a little boy
Don’t blame the drunk caller

Not even a little bit, I was away
And I’m just an arrogant son of a bitch

I know that you're tryna be friends, I know you mean it
Don't call me ""baby"" again, it's hard for me to go home
Be so lonely

I just hope you see me in a little better light
Do you think it's easy being of the jealous kind?
’Cause I miss the shape of your lips
You’ll win, it's just a trick
And this is it, so I’m sorry

The speaker is trying to make the most of the time they have left with their partner, and wishes to prolong the moment by avoiding conversation and turning up the music.

The central idea of the song is the chemistry between two people that is not eternal, but has a strong impact in the moment. The violet color mentioned in the chorus is often associated with passion, creativity, and love, hinting at the intensity of the relationship. The lyrics suggest that being together is all that matters in this fleeting moment, and the speaker wants to feel the embrace of their partner for as long as possible.

The bridge of the song refers to the artistic process of mixing colors, which could be interpreted as a metaphor for the blending of different personalities or energies. The words ""nocturnal, nothing more"" near the end could suggest that the relationship is a temporary one, and both parties are aware of that fact. However, it does not dampen the intensity of the connection they have in the moment. In conclusion, ""Violet Chemistry"" is an ode to living in the present and surrendering to the magic of human connection. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Miley+Cyrus/_/Violet+Chemistry"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

I decide to go over and lend a helping hand, you know?

She replied, ""Oh, yes, you have lost something

[Verse 2]
Everybody knows my past now
Like my house was always made of glass
And maybe that's the price you pay
For the money and fame at an early age
And everybody saw me sick
And it felt like no one gave a shit
They criticized the things I did as an idiot kid[Chorus]
What if you had it all
But nobody to call?
Maybe then you'd know me
'Cause I've had everything
But no one's listening
And that's just fuckin' lonely
[Post-Chorus]

Lo-o-o-onely
I'm so lo-o-o-onely

He trying to roll me up (I ain't sorry)
I ain't picking up (I ain't sorry)
Headed to the club (I ain't sorry)
I ain't thinking 'bout you (I ain't sorry)
Me and my ladies sip my D'USSÉ cups
I don't give a fuck, chucking my deuces up
Suck on my balls, pause, I had enough (Sorry, I ain't sorry)

No, no, hell nah[Verse 2]
Now you wanna say you're sorry
Now you wanna call me crying
Now you gotta see me wilding

And I don't feel bad about it
It's exactly what you get
Stop interrupting my grinding

I ain't thinking 'bout you

I ain't sorry, nigga, nah
Sorry, I ain't sorry
Sorry, I ain't sorry

No, no, hell nah[Bridge]
Looking at my watch, he shoulda been home
Today, I regret the night I put that ring on
He always got them fucking excuses
I pray to the Lord you reveal what his truth is
[Outro]
I left a note in the hallway
By the time you read it, I'll be far away
I'm far away
But I ain't fucking with nobody
Let's have a toast to the good life
Suicide before you see this tear fall down my eyes
Me and my baby, we gon' be alright
We gon' live a good life
Big homie better grow up
Me and my whoadies 'bout to stroll up
I see them boppers in the corner
They sneaking out the back door
He only want me when I'm not there
He better call Becky with the good hair
He better call Becky with the good hair",https://genius.com/Beyonce-sorry-lyrics,"""Sorry"" is a song recorded by American singer Beyoncé for her sixth studio album Lemonade (2016).

It was written and produced by Wynter Gordon, Sean ""Melo-X"" Rhoden and Beyoncé. Columbia Records serviced it to radio stations as the album's second single on May 3, 2016. ""Sorry"" is an electropop song with a thumping rhythm created by drum beats, synthesizers and bells. The song's lyrics revolve around the protagonist dealing with betrayal of a companion with a woman. Due to the numerous allegations featured in the song, media linked its subject matter to the singer and her spouse, Jay Z.

Music critics mostly praised its lyrics and anthemic nature, deeming it an album standout. The ""Becky with the good hair"" line was met with speculations about the identity behind the mentioned mistress, therefore promoting Lemonade. It debuted at number eleven on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and became Beyoncé's second highest career debut on that chart.

The song's music video is part of a one-hour film with the same title as its parent album, Lemonade, which originally aired on HBO on April 23, 2016. It was later released to Vevo on June 22, 2016 as the first standalone clip from the album. It features a spoken word poetry by Somali-English poet Warsan Shire, Beyoncé dancing along with a group of female dancers with painted bodies and a cameo appearance by tennis player Serena Williams. Critics emphasized Williams's dancing as its highlight. Beyoncé performed ""Sorry"" live during The Formation World Tour (2016).

Background and recording

""Sorry"" was written and produced by Wynter Gordon, Sean ""Melo-X"" Rhoden and Beyoncé. Hit-Boy served as the track's co-producer, Stuart White handled the additional production and Beyoncé was responsible for the vocal production. It was recorded with the guidance of Stuart White at the The Beehive Studios in Los Angeles. White also handled the song's audio mixing and mix engineering. The mastering of ""Sorry"" was finished by Dave Kutch at two studios: The Mastering Palace NYC and Pacifique Recording Studios located in North Holywood. Chrissy Collins provides backing vocals throughout the song.

Beyoncé first heard of ""Melo-X"" after he had released an EP titled Yoncé-X (2014) consisting of remixes of songs from her fifth self-titled studio album. That same year, he collaborated with her on various projects, including On the Run, her co-joint tour with Jay Z. The following year, ""Melo-X"" was invited to work with the singer during the sessions for her sixth studio album, Lemonade; two of the tracks he worked on, ""Hold Up"" and ""Sorry"" were included on its final track listing. During an interview with Pitchfork Media, he elaborated about his work on ""Sorry"", recalling that it was written in the summer of 2015. While conceiving the track, ""Melo-X"" tried to incorporate dancehall influences, something that was part of his culture as a Jamaican. He described the idea behind ""Sorry"" as ""pretty simple"": ""It was just some cool keys, drum patterns, and we started putting down vocal ideas and lyric ideas"". Later, Hit-Boy contributed to the song, adding various sounds and layers. ""Melo-X"" further pointed out that ""Sorry"" was a ""vital point"" on the record due to ""all these different emotions and different sounds and different layers"". ""Sorry"" was sent to rhythmic adult contemporary radio in the US on May 3, 2016 as the album's second single. It was also serviced to contemporary hit radio stations in Italy and the US on May 6 and May 10, 2016 respectively

Composition and lyrical analysis

""Sorry"" is an up-tempo electropop track with a thumping and bleeping beat. Drowned in Sound writer Giuseppe Zevolli called it an emulation of early 2000s R&B. The 405's Samantha O'Connor described it as an ""electro-infused"" track. It is instrumentally complete with shattering drum beats, synthesizers and bells, the latter instruments prominent throughout the chorus. The Atlantic writer Spencer Kornhaber likened the electronic layers of ""Sorry"" to the 2015 eponymous song by Justin Bieber. He further found its chorus similar to Top 40 music, but with a ""glassy-eyed distance to the song, a purposeful malaise"". Mike Wass of the website Idolator felt that ""Sorry"" was intended as a female response to ""I Don't Fuck with You"" (2014) by Big Sean and further found similar phrases.

The song's lyrics revolve around the protagonist's cheating lover and her way of dealing with the adultery. Following the release of Lemonade speculations arose about the singer's husband Jay Z's alleged infidelity with a mistress referred to as ""Becky"". Jon Pareles in The New York Times pointed out that many of the accusations were ""aimed specifically and recognizably"" at him. Similarly, Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone magazine noted the lines ""Suck on my balls, I've had enough"" were an ""unmistakable hint"" that the lyrics revolve around Jay Z."" Alexis Petridis from The Guardian also interpreted the lines as Beyoncé declaring she was prepared to abandon him and take her daughter along. He also found the lyrics ""Big homie better grow up"" as a reference of the self-given title by Jay Z during his guest appearance on their past collaboration ""Crazy in Love"" (2003). NME writer Larry Bartleet was of the opinion that the singer was ""thrillingly honest sucker-punch"" on the song's lyrics aimed at Jay Z. On the other hand, Lindsay Mannering from Bustle magazine felt that it was hard to determine whether the lyrics were inspired by the pair's private life due to the prominent usage of innuendos. However, she later clarified that although the song may not necessarily be autobiographical, ""Beyonce has a tendency to reveal her truth through music... so it's possible that 'Sorry' references her emotions after Jay allegedly cheated on her"".

""Sorry"" has been described as a defiant, spiteful song exemplified in the lyrics, ""Looking at my watch, he shoulda been home"". The song opens with the lyrics of the hook ""Sorry, I ain't sorry"", with the protagonist seemingly apologizing for something, but as it turns out later, she adopts an unapologetic stance realizing she was the victim. It features the lyrics ""Boy bye"" and gives an instruction to put the middle fingers up; the singer finds personal empowerment in those lines. The protagonist talk-sings the lines ""Today I regret the night I put that ring on"" in which she expresses regret over the decision of marrying her husband. She also tells her love interest that she wrote a ""Dear John-type letter"" for him. During one part, she sings about putting her deuces up which clarifies that she is over the relationship. Andre Grant of HipHopDX noted how the song was a proof of the fast-shifting emotions the protagonist feels throughout ""Sorry"" as seen in the lines ""I ain't sorry / Boy, bye"", ""He only want me when I'm not there / He better call Becky with the good hair"" and ""Let's take a toast to the good life / Suicide before you see this tear fall down my eye"". Zevolli also opined that the song's second part is ""by far one of the most surprising mood-swings on the record"". <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Beyonc%C3%A9/_/Sorry"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Devil Always Made Me Think Twice Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I take a little smoke in the evenin'
I take a little whiskey on ice
I never get behind on killin' my mind
It's just the kind of things I like
Just the kind of things I like

The minute that I saw you walkin' over
I figured I was diggin' my grave
Well, you had the shovel, I knew you were trouble
But you're just the kind of trouble I crave
Just the kind of trouble I crave

And mama always set a good example
Daddy always gave me good advice
Jesus tried to steer me in the right direction
But the devil always made me think twice
Devil always made me think
[Verse 3]
Someday I'm goin' six feet under
And when I'm standin' at the gate
They'll tally up my sins, they won't let me in
Sayin' ""Son, you're just a little too late""
""Son, you're just a little too late""[Chorus]
My mama always set a good example
Daddy always gave me good advice
Jesus tried to steer me in the right direction
But the devil always made me think twice

The slightest words you said
Have all gone to my head
I hear angels sing in your voice
When you pull me close
Feelings I’ve never known
They mean everything
And leave me no choice

Light on my heart
Light on my feet
Light in your eyes
I can’t even speak
Do you even know how you make me weak?

You’re in control of my heart

Keep me from falling apart[Verse 2]

What happened to just fallin in love with a nigga with a bus pass --
-- just cause you love the nigga?
But I'm the pimp motherfucker!
I gotta be the player!
Biggest hoes, on planet Earth..
.. are walkin through the motherfuckin neighborhood
You KNEW when you got with the nigga he already had a woman
You knew he already had a family
But you fucked him anyway!!!
And then when you thought you gon' lose the nigga
You went and got pregnant - didn't you bitch, DIDN'T YOU!!
THE OL' KEEP A NIGGA BABY
And then when the nigga ain't around, what do you tell the child?
""Aww that nigga ain't shit, that's why yo' daddy ain't here;
Cause that nigga ain't shit.""
How bout bein a woman, and tellin the kid the truth
That yo' momma, you was a ho!
TELL THE KID!
Momma was a ho, I was weekend pussy
I had you to keep the nigga, it didn't work out
That's why he ain't here - but he a good nigga
Cause he take care of his REAL family
I was just a dumb bitch, tryin to keep, a nigga that I wanted",https://genius.com/Dr-dre-ed-ucation-lyrics,"",""

[Verse 1]
You've got a hold on me
Don't even know your power
I stand a hundred feet
But I fall when I'm around ya
Show me an open door
And you go and slam it on me
I can't take anymore
[Chorus]
I'm saying
Baby, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
[Verse 2]
I'd drive through the night
Just to be near you, baby
Heart open, testify
Tell me that I'm not crazy
I'm not asking for a lot
Just that you're honest with me
And my pride is all I got[Chorus]
I'm saying
Baby, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy on me?
I'm a puppet on your strings
And even though you got good intentions
I need you to set me free
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
[Bridge]
Consuming all the air inside my lungs
Ripping all the skin from off my bones
I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
I would gladly do it twice
Consuming all the air inside my lungs
Ripping all the skin from off my bones
I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
I would gladly do it twice
[Chorus]
Oh, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy on me?
I'm a puppet on your string
And even though you got good intentions
I need you to set me free
I'm begging you for mercy, mercy
I'm begging you, begging you, please, baby

Honest Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Hey, how's it going?
Can you meet me down on Adelaide Street?
Can you talk for a moment?
There's no way to say this that easily
And everything I said, I swear I meant it
I need to tell you that this isn't your fault
And I know that I'll probably regret it
And it kills me 'cause the worst part of all
[Chorus]
Is that I hate to hurt you
But I got to be honest
I can't give you what you need, oh
You deserve more than I can promise
And I'm just tryna, I'm just tryna
Baby, I'm just tryna be honest, yeah
I'm tryna be honest with ya
You know that I'm sorry
But I'm tryna be honest with ya
[Verse 2]
Hey, can you listen?
I swear to God to you, there's nobody else
You're gonna say that I'm lying
When I tell you every feeling I felt
Was honest and sincere in that you were different
And when we kissed, I felt like that kid in love, yeah
And I know that I'll probably regret it
I might wish I never said this at all[Chorus]
Oh, I hate to hurt you
But I got to be honest
I can't give you what you need, oh
You deserve more than I can promise
And I'm just tryna, I'm just tryna
Baby, I'm just tryna be honest, yeah
I'm tryna be honest with ya
You know that I'm sorry
But I'm tryna be honest with ya
[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh
I don't wanna see you cry
Oh, oh, oh
Swear that I don't wanna see you cry

'Cause I hate to hurt you
But I got to be honest
I can't give you what you need, oh
You deserve more than I can promise
And I'm just tryna, I'm just tryna

Nashville, TN Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I met you when I had a dream
Not so long ago, it seems
We closed down a million bars
Yeah, you and me, we've come so far
You showed me how to write a song
We wrote some right, we wrote some wrong
I was down and out, you let me in
At times you were my only friend
[Chorus]
So long, Nashville, Tennessee
You can't have what's left of me
And as far as I can tell
It's high time, I wish you well
You build me up, you set me free
You tore down my memories
So you be you and I'll be me
So long, Nashville, Tennessee
[Verse 2]
Now you won't miss me when I'm gone
You're custom made for movin' on
And time to time I'll pass you by
Face that I don't recognize
And who knows? Maybe years from now
You'll be the one I think about
But I just can't imagine that
'Cause I'm not one for lookin' back[Chorus]
So long, Nashville, Tennessee
You can't have what's left of me
And as far as I can tell
It's high time, I wish you well
You build me up, you set me free
You tore down my memories
So you be you and I'll be me

Where Are We Goin’ Lyrics

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh

Where are we goin' when we leave here?
When the music's over and the bar runs out of beer
If we stay too late, they're gonna kick us out
Is it cool if I come crash at your house?
Where are we going? The night is young
And we're both half sober, hell bent on having fun
You say if we hook up, there'll be no strings attached
Save my number, you don't have to call me back
Let's have some cigarettes and find a spot that ain't closed yet
And if it is, we'll buy a 
box of wine
I just had to talk to you, forgive me if this comes out rude
You got to know it's true, but girl, you 
look so fine

Chancie Neal

Luke Bryan & Chancie Neal

Where are we going? If nowhere else
There's an old field road, out past the shut down Shell
We could shine those eyes, we could count them stars
Borrow some signs, go fishing in the dark
We'll sing some old Hank Junior songs, ""Outlaw Women"" all night long
Make some good ol' down home 
memories
There's something 'bout the sky tonight, something 'bout your blue eyes
Baby, you remind me of my 
sweetest dream
My sweetest dream
My sweetest dream
Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah[Outro: Luke Bryan, 
Chancie Neal

Where are we going? If this is love
There's no way to know but just between the two of us
It all feels so right with you in my arms
Where it's going, I don't know, but let's keep following our hearts

Yeah

[Intro: Bushwick Bill]
""Yes, it is I,"" says me
And all who agree are more than three 'cause they're we, haha
Yes, yo, I'm in the house now for sure
Because I wanna talk about the hearts of men
Who knows what evil lurks within them?
But let's take a travel down the blindside
And see what we find on this path called
[Verse 1: Kurupt]
Stranded on death row, so duck when I swing my shit
I get rugged like Rawhead Rex with fat tracks that fits
The gangster type, what I recite's kinda lethal
Niggas know the flow that I kick, there's no equal
I'm murderin' niggas, yo, and maybe because of the tone I kicks
When I grip the mic and kick shit niggas can't fuck with
So remember I go hardcore and slam
'Nough respect like a sensei,
 
whoop ass like Van Damme
So any nigga that claim they bossin'
Why don't you bring your ass on over to Crenshaw and Slauson?
Take a walk through the hood where we up to no good
Slangin' them things like a real OG should
I'm stackin' and mackin' and packin' a ten, so
When you're slippin', I slip the clip in, but ain't no set trippin'
'Cause it's Death Row, rollin' like the mafia
Think about whoopin' some ass, but what the fuck stoppin' you?
Ain't nothin' but a buster
I'm stranded on death row for pumpin' slugs in motherfuckers
Now you know you're outdone, feel the shotgun
Kurupt, inmate, cell block one[Verse 2: RBX]
No prevention from this lynchin' of sorts
You're a victim from my drive-by of thoughts
No extensions, all attempts are to fail
Blinded by the light, it's time you learn braille
From a lunatic, I'm death like arsenic
When I kick a wicked rap, Dr. Dre will kick the scratch
With treachery, my literary form will blast
And totally surpass the norm
Not a storm, plural, make it many storms
When I'm vexed, I fight leg, necks, and arms
In this dimension, I'm the presenter
And the inventor, and the tormentor
Deranged, like the Hillside Strangler
Emcee mangler, 
tough like Wrangler
I write a rhyme, hard as concrete
Step to the heat and get burned like mesquite
So what you wanna do?
The narrator RBX, cell block two
[Verse 3: The Lady of Rage]
Rage, lyrical murderer
Stranded on death row and now I'm servin' a
Lifetime sentence, there'll be no repentance
Since it's the life that I choose to lead, I plead guilty
On all counts, let the ball bounce where it may
It's just another clip into my AK
Buck 'em down with my underground tactics
Facts and stacks of clips on my mattress
Bed frame, there's another dead dame
Laying lame, put to shame, who's to blame?
Me, the Lady of Rage, a woman comin'
From the D-E-A-T-H and R-O-W, takin' no shit
So flip and you're bound to get dropped
It's 1-8-7 on motherfuckers, don't stop
Handcuffed as I bust, there'll be no debate
It's Rage, from cell block H[Verse 4: Snoop Dogg]
Ayo, steppin' through the fog and creepin' through the smog
It's the number one nigga from the hood, Doggy Dogg
Making videos, now I stay in Hollywood
Bustin' raps for my snaps, now they call me Eastwood
Dre is the doctor and my homie, lil' nigga
Warren G is my hand and my hand's on the trigger
Shootin' at the hoes with the game that I got
Sent to death row 'cause I wanted to make a grip from servin' my rocks
And I'm still servin' for mine
Peace to my motherfuckin' homies doin' time
In the pen and the county jail
Mobbin' with your blues on
, mad as hell
And you're sayin', ""Fuck the police""
And all the homies on the streets is all about peace
And it's drivin' the cops crazy
But ain't nothin' but a black thing, baby
Uh, I'm not flaggin', but I'm just saggin'
I bet you don't wanna see the D-O-double-G
And you can't see the D-R to the E
Or my motherfuckin' homie D.O.C
You know you can't fuck with my motherfuckin' DJ
That's my homie and we call him Warren G
Yeah, and you don't stop
Doggy Dogg break 'em down with the motherfuckin' Dogg Pound
That's the only way we'll beat 'em, man
We gotta smoke 'em then choke 'em like the motherfuckin' Peterman
It's like three and to the two and two and to the one
Cell block four, peace, Doggy Dogg's done[Outro: Bushwick Bill]
Yo, now you know the path I'm on
You think you're strong?
See if you can travel on
'Cause only the weak will try to speak
Those who are quiet will always cause riots
There's three types of people in the world
Those who don't know what happened
Those who wonder what happened
And people like us from the streets that make things happen",https://genius.com/Dr-dre-stranded-on-death-row-lyrics,"",""

[Verse 1]
You don't know how little you matter until you're all alone
In the middle of Arkansas with a little rock left in that glass dick
Used to date a blonde, you used to hit it raw
'Cause she was and you are madly involved, madly involved
[Chorus]
Hittin' stones in glass homes
You're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
You hit them stones and broke your home
Crack rock, crack rock
Crack rock, crack rock
Hittin' stones in glass homes
You're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
You hit them stones and broke your home (Ooh, ah, ooh)
Crack rock, crack rock
Crack rock, crack rock
[Verse 2]
You're shuckin' and jivin', stealin' and robbin'
To get the fixing that you're itching for
Your family stopped inviting you to things
Won't let you hold their infant
You used to get a little cut-up from time to time
But the freaks ain't trying to sleep with cracky[Chorus]
Hittin' stones in glass homes
You're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
You hit them stones, and you broke your home
Crack rock
Crack rock, crack rock
[Verse 3]
Crooked cop, dead cop
How much dope can you push to me?
Crooked cop, dead cop
No good for community
Fuckin' pig get shot, three hundred men will search for me
My brother get popped, and don't no one hear the sound
Don't no one hear the rounds (Ooh, sound)
Don't no one hear the shells (Ooh, shells)
Don't no one hear a sound
Don't no one disturb the peace for riot
Don't no one disrupt nirvana
Don't no one wanna blow the high

[Chorus]
Sixteen carriages drivin' away
While I watch them ride with my dreams away
To the summer sunset on a holy night
On a long black road, all the tears I fight
Sixteen carriages drivin' away
While I watch them ride with my dreams away
To the summer sunset on a holy night
On a long black road, all the tears I fight
[Verse 1]
At fifteen, the innocence was gone astray
Had to leave my home at an early age
I saw Mama prayin', I saw Daddy grind
All my tender problems, had to leave behind
[Pre-Chorus]
It's been umpteen summers, and I'm not in my bed
On the back of the bus in a bunk with the band
Goin' so hard, gotta choose myself
Undеrpaid and overwhelmed
I might cook, clеan, but still won't fold
Still workin' all my life, you know
Only God knows, only God knows
Only God knows[Chorus]
Sixteen carriages drivin' away
While I watch them ride with my fears away
To the summer sunset on a holy night
On a long black road, all the tears I fight
Sixteen carriages drivin' away
While I watch them ride with my fears away
To the summer sunset on a holy night
On a long back road, all the tears I fight
[Verse 2]
Sixteen dollars, workin' all day
Ain't got time to waste, I got art to make
I got love to create on this holy night
They won't dim my light, all these years I fight
[Pre-Chorus]
It's been thirty-eight summers, and I'm not in my bed
On the back of the bus in a bunk with the band
Goin' so hard, now I miss my kids
Overworked and overwhelmed
I might cook, clean, but still won't fold
Still workin' all my life, you know
Only God knows, only God knows
Only God knows[Chorus]
Sixteen carriages driving away
While I watch them ride with my fears away
To the summer sunset on a holy night
On a long black road, all the tears I fight
Sixteen carriages driving away
While I watch them ride with my fears away
To the summer sunset on a holy night
On a long back road, all these tears I fight
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh
Oh
[Bridge]
At fifteen, the innocence was gone astray
Had to take care of home at an early age
I saw Mama cryin', I saw Daddy lyin'
Had to sacrifice and leave my fears behind
For legacy, if it's the last thing I do
You'll remember me 'cause we got somethin' to prove
In your memory, on the highway to truth
Still see our faces when you close your eyes

In an interview for Rolling Stone, Randolph explained the recording session in Los Angeles with Beyoncé, Rhiannon Giddens, Saadiq and Khirye Tyler:

When we did the first session, ... Beyoncé already had an idea of what she wanted to do. She wanted to do something with some playing, with some country fire. [...] It’s great for her to go this route. In country music for the longest time, it almost seemed like it was supposed to be out of left field when a Black artist says, ‘Hey, I’m going to do a country record.’

How Much a Dollar Cost Lyrics
Up until this point in the album, Kendrick’s been plagued by Lucy & Uncle Sam. On his road to recovery, he runs into a homeless man at a gas station in South Africa.

He tells the story of a man asking for 10…

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
How much a dollar really cost?
The question is detrimental, paralyzin' my thoughts
Parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling, y'all
Gotta see how I'm chillin' once I park this luxury car
Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo
""20 on pump 6,"" dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo
Twenty years ago, can't forget
Now I can lend him a ear or two
How to stack these residuals tenfold
The liberal concept of what men'll do
""20 on 6,"" he didn't hear me
Indigenous African only spoke Zulu
My American tongue was leery
Walked out the gas station
A homeless man with a semi-tan complexion
Asked me for ten Rand, stressin' about dry land
Deep water, powder blue skies that crack open
A piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin'
He begged and pleaded
Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it
Told him, ""Beat it""
Contributin' money just for his pipe—I couldn't see it
He said, ""My son, temptation is one thing that I've defeated
Listen to me, I want a single bill from you
Nothin' less, nothin' more""
I told him I ain't have it and closed my door
Tell me, how much a dollar cost?[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]
It's more to feed your mind
Water, sun and love, the one you love
All you need, the air you breathe
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
He's starin' at me in disbelief
My temper is buildin', he's starin' at me, I grab my key
He's starin' at me, I started the car, then I tried to leave
And somethin' told me to keep it in park until I could see
The reason why he was mad at a stranger
Like I was supposed to save him
Like I'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor
He's starin' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser
He's starin' at me, I notice that his stare is contagious
'Cause now I'm starin' back at him, feelin' some type of disrespect
If I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin' at his neck
I never understood someone beggin' for goods
Askin' for handouts, takin' it if they could
And this particular person just had it down pat
Starin' at me for the longest until he finally asked
""Have you ever opened up Exodus 14?
A humble man is all that we ever need""
Tell me, how much a dollar cost?
[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]
It's more to feed your mind
Water, sun and love, the one you love
All you need, the air you breathe[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Guilt trippin' and feelin' resentment
I never met a transient that demanded attention
They got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin'
Sour emotions got me lookin' at the universe different
I should distance myself, I should keep it relentless
My selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck I'm kiddin'?
So I'ma tell you like I told the last bum
Crumbs and pennies, I need all of mines
And I recognize this type of panhandlin' all the time
I got better judgment, I know when nigga's hustlin', keep in mind
When I was strugglin', I did compromise, now I comprehend
I smell Grandpa's old medicine, reekin' from your skin
Moonshine and gin, nigga, you're babblin', your words ain't flatterin'
I'm imaginin' Denzel but lookin' at O'Neal
Kazaam is sad thrills, your gimmick is mediocre
The jig is up, I seen you from a mile away losin' focus
And I'm insensitive, and I lack empathy
He looked at me and said, ""Your potential is bittersweet""
I looked at him and said, ""Every nickel is mines to keep""
He looked at me and said, ""Know the truth, it'll set you free
You're lookin' at the Messiah, the son of Jehovah, the higher power
The choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit
The nerve of Nazareth, and I'll tell you just how much a dollar cost
The price of having a spot in Heaven, embrace your loss—I am God""[Outro: Ronald Isley]
I washed my hands, I said my grace
What more do you want from me?
Tears of a clown, guess I'm not all what it's all meant to be
Shades of grey will never change if I condone
Turn this page, help me change to right my wrongs

His selfishness, towards which he attributes his success, eventually comes out most in his interactions with the homeless man. At that point, the man reveals himself to be God – his selfishness and unwillingness to give the homeless man a dollar has cost him his place in Heaven. This revelation harks back to the parable of “The Sheep and the Goat.”

[Verse 1]
I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds
Or fades in time
[Chorus]
And I never (Never)
Saw you coming
And I’ll never (Never)
Be the same
[Verse 2]
You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now, all we know is don’t let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes
[Pre-Chorus]
So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild[Chorus]
And I never (Never)
Saw you coming
And I’ll never (Never)
Be the same
[Bridge]
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You’re my Achilles heel
This is the golden age
Of something good and right and real
[Chorus]
And I never (Never)
Saw you coming
And I’ll never
Be the same
And I never (Never)
Saw you coming
And I’ll never
 (So you were never a saint)
(And I've loved in shades of wrong)
Be the same

Heera Lyrics
This is how it ends
No money, no friends
And I just got a hard-on
(Roo, roo, roo)
(Roo, roo, roo)
I'm leaving the past
I'm giving what I can
Even though I have none
(Roo, roo, roo)
(Roo, roo, roo)
And life was so easy
Things are so clear
I don't even know anymore
(Roo, roo, roo)
(Roo, roo, roo)
I could feel the sea
Oh, I could live a lovely lie
I could live a lovely lie
I could live a lovely lie
I could live a lovely
Maybe, I'm an act
The kind who fails again
I'm ticking like a time bomb
(Roo, roo, roo)
(Roo, roo, roo)So, give me what I need
To suffer in peace
Living on an island
(Roo, roo, roo)
(Roo, roo, roo)
And life was so easy
Things are so clear
I don't even know anymore
(Roo, roo, roo)
Maybe what I feel
(Roo, roo, roo)
Maybe, it could disappear
And I could live a lovely lie
I could live a lovely lie
I could live a lovely lie
I could live a lovely lie
But I gotta know
This is how it ends
No money, no friends
And I just got a hard-on
(Roo, roo, roo)
(Roo, roo, roo)My world only demands
The silence of a man
Living on the sidewalk
(Roo, roo, roo)
(Roo, roo, roo)
Your life was so easy
Things are so clear
I don't even know anymore
(Roo, roo, roo)
Maybe, I should change
Maybe, I could rearrange
Oh, I could live a lovely lie
I could live a lovely lie
I could live a lovely lie
I could live a lovely lie
But, I gotta know
I would rather know",https://genius.com/Peter-cat-recording-co-heera-lyrics,"",""

You said I was the most exotic flower
Holdin' me tight in our final hour
I don't know how you convince them and get them, babe
I don't know what you do, it's unbelievable
And I don't know how you get over, get over
Someone as dangerous, tainted and flawed as you

One for the money and two for the show
I love you, honey, I'm ready, I'm ready to go
How did you get that way? I don't know
You're screwed up and brilliant
Look like a million dollar man
So why is my heart broke?
[Verse 2]
You've got the world, but baby, at what price?
Something so strange, hard to define
It isn't that hard, boy, to like you or love you
I'd follow you down, down, down, you're unbelievable
If you're goin' crazy, just grab me and take me
I'd follow you down, down, down anywhere, anywhere

One for the money, two for the show

Same lips red, same eyes blue
Same white shirt, couple more tattoos
But it's not you, and it's not me
Tastes so sweet, looks so real
Sounds like something that I used to feel
But I can't touch what I see
[Chorus]
We're not who we used to be
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts standin' in the place of you and me
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heart beat

The fridge light washes this room white
Moon dances over your good side
And this was all we used to need
Tongue-tied like we've never known
Tellin' those stories we already told
'Cause we don't say what we really mean

Through the wire, through the wire, through the wire
I'm watching her dance, dress is catching the light
In her eyes, there's no lies, no lies
There's no question, she's not in a disguise

With no way out and a long way down
Everybody needs someone around
But I can't hold you too close now
Through the wire, through the wire

What a feeling to be right here beside you now
Holding you in my arms
When the air ran out and we both started running wild
The sky fell down
But you've got stars, they're in your eyes
And I've got something missing tonight
What a feeling to be a king beside you, somehow
I wish I could be there now

[Intro]
She loves me, she loves me not (Yeah)
She loves me not
[Verse 1]
The fiends need me, I ain't around, they bones ache
Detox, rehab, cold sweats, watch them shake
I'm not that genie in a bottle, I'm in a bag
Take one hit and slide off to the Land of H, man
When we first met, I thought you'd never doubt me
Now, you tryna leave me, you never live without me
Girl, I'm missing you, come and see me soon
Tie your arm up, put that lighter under that spoon
Now, put that needle to your arm princess, stick it in, relapse
I'm back, bitch—don't ever try that again
All the shit I did for you, I made you feel good
We have a love thing, you treatin' this like it's just a fling
What we have is more sacred than a vow or a ring
You broke my heart, you dirty bitch, I won't forget what you did
If you give birth, I'll already be in love with your kids
Listen, I don't give a damn if your ass starts smokin'
But we have a bond that is not to be broken
[Chorus]
We got a love thing, girl, you tried to leave me
But you need me, can you see you're addicted to me?
We got a love thing, 
I can take you higher, girl
Fucking with me, you can be all you can be
We got a love thing, girl you tried to leave me
But you need me, can you see you're addicted to me?
We got a love thing, I can take you higher, girl
Fucking with me, you can be all you can be[Verse 2]
Baby, you know, on the low, your sister been eyein' me
I'm good-looking, so you know, soon, she be trying me
Heard she bisexual, she fuck with that girl
But boy, oh boy, fucking wit me is a whole 'nother world
After that first night she fall in love, then chase the feelin
I hung out with Marvin when he wrote ""Sexual Healing""
Kurt Cobain—we were good friends; Ozzy Osbourne, too
I be with rock stars—see, you lucky I'm fucking with you
I chilled with Frankie Lymon and Jimi Hendrix crew
See, this is new to you, but to me, this ain't new
I live the lavish life; listen, if the mood is right
Me, you, and your sister can do the do tonight
I never steer you wrong; if you hyper, I make you calm
I'll be your incentive, a reason for you to move forward
Let's make a date, promise me you'll come to see me
Even if it means you have to sell your mama's TV
I love you—love me back; no one said loving me'd be easy
[Chorus]
We got a love thing, girl, you tried to leave me
But you need me, can you see you're addicted to me?
We got a love thing, I can take you higher, girl
Fucking with me, you can be all you can be
We got a love thing, girl you tried to leave me
But you need me, can you see you're addicted to me?
We got a love thing, I can take you higher, girl
Fucking with me, you can be all you can be (I love you)[Verse 3]
I got you barefooted on glass, chasing a dove
That monkey on your back symbolizes my love
Your friends talk bad about me, bitch, you sit there and listen to 'em
Over and over you hurt me, my love is unconditional
They talk to you when you up; when you down, they got nothing to say
But when you call up, I come running, I always take the pain away
They set you up to let you down; they crowned you prom queen
They know 'bout me; behind your back, they call you a fucking fiend
Can we just be alone so I can kiss and hug you?
Push me inside you; no other man can love you like I do
Call me Daddy, I'll make you feel good, I mean, real good
I find pleasure in pleasing you like a real man should
It was written long before us; it was carved in a tree
Forever, me and you, baby, we were meant to be
There's more to life than laughter; what brought us together was fate
And we'll be hand in hand when you walk through those pearly gates
And to see to that, I'ma do whatever it takes
[Chorus]
We got a love thing, girl, you tried to leave me
But you need me, can you see you're addicted to me?
We got a love thing, I can take you higher, girl
Fucking with me, you can be all you can be
We got a love thing, girl you tried to leave me
But you need me, can you see you're addicted to me?
We got a love thing, I can take you higher, girl
Fucking with me, you can be all you can be",https://genius.com/50-cent-a-baltimore-love-thing-lyrics,"",""

Fortune Teller Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I'm not a fortune teller, I won't be bringing news
Of what tomorrow brings, I'll leave that up to you
I'm not a fortune teller, don't have a crystal ball
I can't predict the future, can't see nothing at all
It doesn't mean I'm afraid of all the things that you say
But I just think we should stay stuck in the moment today
And as the seasons roll by, no matter how hard I try
Summer will end and the leaves will turn again
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know why you're acting like this
I don't know why you had to do it again
Why'd you have to go and ruin the night?
Don't worry about tomorrow's mess
[Chorus]
I'll never know how the future will go
I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller
I'll never change, but I want you to stay
I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller
[Verse 2]
I don't like watching TV, I don't know what it all means
And your American dream, baby, it just isn't me
I know what I'm thinking may not be on your mind
I know the song I'm singing is not your favorite kind
It doesn't mean I'm afraid of all the things that you say
But I just think we should stay stuck in the moment today
And as the seasons roll back, no matter how hard I try
Summer will end and the leaves will turn again[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know why you're acting like this
I don't know why you had to do it again
Why'd you have to go and ruin the night?
Don't worry about tomorrow's mess
[Chorus]
I'll never know how the future will go
I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller
I'll never change, but I want you to stay
I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller
[Bridge]
This feeling keeps growing
These rivers keep flowing
How can I have answers
When you drown me in questions?
[Chorus]
I'll never know how the future will go
I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller
I'll never change, but I want you to stay
And I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller
I'll never know how the future will go (Yeah)

[Produced by Dr. Dre & Mel-Man]
[Intro: Phish]
What's the difference between me and you?
What's the difference between me and you?
[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Back when Cube was rollin' with Lorenzo in a Benzo
I was bangin' with a gang of instrumentals
Got the pens and pencils, got down to business
But sometimes, the business end of this shit can turn your friends against you
But you was a real nigga, I could sense it in you
I still remember the window of the car that you went through
That's fucked up – but I'll never forget the shit we been through
And I'ma do whatever it takes to convince you
'Cause you my nigga, Doc
; 
and Eazy, I'm still wit' you
Fuck the beef, nigga, I miss you, and that's just being real wit' you
You see, the truth is, everybody wanna know how close me and Snoop is
And who I'm still cool with
Then, I got these fake-ass niggas I first blew with
Claimin' they non-violent, talkin' like they— (
Do not resist the beat
)
Spit venom in interviews, speakin' on reunions
Move units, then talk shit, and we can do this
Until then, I ain't even speakin' your name
Just keep my name out of your mouth, and we can keep it the same, nigga
It ain't that I'm too big to listen to the rumors
It's just that I'm too damn big to pay attention to 'em
That's the difference[Chorus: Phish]
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'
[Verse 2: Xzibit]
Yo, I stay with it, while you try to perpetrate, play with it
Never knew about the next level until Dre did it (Yeah)
I stay committed while you motherfuckers babysitted
I smash the critics like a overhand right from Riddick (Yeah)
Come and get it, shitted on villains by the millions
I be catchin' bitches while bitches be catchin' feelings
So what the fuck am I supposed to do?
I pop bottles and hot hollow-points at each and all of you (Come on!)
A heartless bastard, high and plastered
My style is like the reaction from too much acid—never come down!
Pass it around if you can't handle it
Hang Hollywood niggas by they Soul Train laminates
What's the difference between me and you? (What?)
About five bank accounts, three ounces, and two vehicles
Until my death, I'm Bangladesh
I suggest you hold your breath 'til ain't none left
Yo, that's the difference![Chorus: Phish]
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions

[Verse 3: Eminem & 
Dr. Dre
]
A'ight, hold up, hold up!
Stop the beat a minute!
 
I got somethin' to say, Dre
I wanna tell you this shit right now while this fuckin' weed is in me (
What the fuck?
)
I don't know if I ever told you this
But I love you, dog, I got your motherfuckin' back (
Right
), just know this shit
Slim, I don't know if you noticed it
But I've had your back from day one,
 
nigga
, let's blow this bitch
I mean it, dog—you ever need somebody offed: ""Whose throat is it?""
Well, if you ever kill that Kim bitch, I'll show you where the ocean is
Well, that's cool, and I appreciate the offer
But if I do decide to really murder my daughter's mama
I'ma sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her
And cruise around with her for seven hours through California
And have her wavin' at people (""Hi!"")
Then drop her off on the corner at the police station
And drive off, honkin' the horn for her (*Beep-beep!*)
Raw dog, get your arm gnawed off
Drop the sawed-off and beat you with the piece it was sawed off of
Fuck blood, I wanna see some lungs coughed up
Get shot up in the hot tub 'til the bubbles pop up
In they nose and cough snot up, mucus and hot water
That's for tryna talk like 
'The Chronic'
 was lost product
That's for even thinkin' of havin' them thoughts thought up
And you better show some respect whenever the Doc's brought up
So what's the difference between us? We can start at the penis
Or we can scream, ""I just don't give a fuck!"" and see who means it[Chorus: Phish]
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'

Dirt Road Diary Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Me and daddy'd ride around all day shooting doves off a line in a Chevrolet
Old lab would jump out the back and fetch them up
We would drive for miles and miles and never once hit blacktop or change the dial
One little country station was all there was
Checking gates, fixing fence and roads
That is how my story goes
[Chorus]
If you want to know the real me, just turn the page in my dirt road diary
It's right there for you to see
Every kiss, every beer, every cotton field memory
Tan legs and some Dixie Land delight
Ridin' round, windows down on a summer night
I was there, that was me
It's right here in my dirt road diary
[Verse 2]
I remember when I turned sixteen; I got a license and some gasoline
Ain't a curve or a straight away we didn't fly down
If it wasn't the boys, it was me and her by fire in a field or down on the river
Every inch of that county was sacred ground
I wish I knew where that old truck was
If it could talk, it could tell on us
[Chorus]
If you want to know the real me, just turn the page in my dirt road diary
It's right there for you to see
Every kiss, every beer, every cotton field memory
Tan legs and some Dixie Land delight
Ridin' round, windows down on a summer night
I was there, that was me
It's right here in my dirt road diary[Bridge]
It ain't a book underneath my bed
Just a dusty memory lane burned in my head
[Chorus]
Tan legs and some Dixie land delight
Ridin' round, windows down, feelin' right
I was there, that was me
It's right here in my dirt road diary
Just ride around my little town and you'll see how I wrote my dirt road diary",https://genius.com/Luke-bryan-dirt-road-diary-lyrics,"",""

Was what I was thinkin' the whole time
Breathe in, breathe through, breathe deep, breathe out
I'll be gettin' over you my whole life

It only feels this raw right now
Lost in the labyrinth of my mind
Break up, break free, break through, break down
You would break your back to make me break a smile

You know how much I hate
That everybody just expects me to bounce back
Just like that[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I've always been the one to say the first goodbye
Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like
Now I'm falling
You say my name like I have never heard before
I'm indecisive, but, this time, I know for sure
I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
Are you falling?
[Pre-Chorus]
Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby
[Chorus]
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?[Verse 2]
I wonder, when you go, if I stay on your mind
Two can play that game, but you win me every time
Everyone before you was a waste of time
Yeah, you got me

Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby

Taking flight, making me feel right

Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind
[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you
[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
'Cause all I know is we said, ""Hello""
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
And everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed
[Outro: Taylor Swift]
All I know is we said, ""Hello""
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain
And everything has changed
All I know is a new found grace
All my days, I'll know your face
All I know since yesterday

Higher than I've ever known
You call the shots and I follow
Sunrise, but the night's still young
No words, but we speak in tongues

[Verse 1]
I was just coastin', never really goin' anywhere
Caught up in a web, I was gettin' kinda used to stayin' there
And out of the blue
I fell for you
[Chorus]
Now, you're lifting me up 'stead of holding me down
Stealing my heart 'stead of stealing my crown
Untangled all the strings 'round my wings that were tied
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud Nine was always out of reach
Now, I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies

Kiss full of color makes me wonder where you've always been
I was hiding in doubt 'til you brought me out of my chrysalis
And I came out new
All because of you

And now, you're lifting me up 'stead of holding me down
Stealing my heart 'stead of stealing my crown
Untangled all the strings 'round my wings that were tied

The track holds a slow and steady cadence as it is laced around a Dez Wright-made sample, looping the words “La, la, la, la,” which ultimately builds the warped sound while providing a melancholy undertone to it.

The song was originally supposed to be featured on Kanye West’s tenth full-length studio album, Donda, but it was removed for unknown reasons and was eventually released solo.

First previewed from a leaked documentary directed by Dame Dash, Travis officially previewed the track on August 6, 2022 — alongside “LOST FOREVER” — while headlining at the O2 Arena in London.

A week before the album’s official release, it was previewed for the final time at iHeartRadio on July 20, 2023, and was described as “an exclusive snippet of an additional track from UTOPIA”.

On July 29, 2023, Travis released the official music video which portrayed a strong image of a low-income neighborhood, suggesting that the idea behind “GOD’S COUNTRY” is that God’s country is a place where there are small and incomparable moments in your hometown — as if they’re God’s wish — which are near impossible to replace. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Travis+Scott/_/GOD%27S+COUNTRY"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Okay, I been up for some days, I ain't got time to lay
Just to drown out all these thoughts, I tried all kind of things
If I take you to my past, you will be traumatized
Got a thousand kids outside that's tryna come alive
'99, took AstroWorld, it had to relocate
Told the dawgs I'd bring it back, it was a seal of faith
Before no car notes, baby girl, she played the tourist guide
Got the keys into my city, now she know the rides
Got new money, got new problems, got new enemies
When you make it to the top, that's the amenities
Packin' out Toyota like I'm in the league
And it ain't a mosh pit if ain't no injuries
I got 'em stage divin' out the nosebleeds
 
(
Alright, alright, alright
)
And she hit that booger sugar 'til her nose bleed
 
(
Alright, alright, alright

Bounce that shit forever, she on both knees
She was talkin' 'bout forever, got a whole week

Alright, alright, alright

Plus, she know my baby mama is a trophy
She be throwin' up them B's, feel like we both bleed
She keep my dick jumpin' up, feel like I'm Moby
I'm way too gold for this beef, feel like I'm Kobe, yeah
This right here is astronomical
I see you picked up all my ways, I feel responsible

The song received critical acclaim from critics and is considered a highlight on Astroworld. Writing for Pitchfork, Michelle Kim gave the song a positive review, calling it a ""potent earworm"" and named it a ""best new track"". Reviewing Astroworld for The Fader, Ben Dandridge-Lemco praised Scott as sounding ""dexterous"" over the song's ""dizzying"" production, adding that the song's beat switch served as the album's ""first loop-de-loop"". In Consequence of Sound's review for the album, Wren Graves listed the song as an ""essential track"" and praised the two halves of the track, saying, ""Scott balances the two ideas like a chef balancing sweet and sour, enhancing each with the inclusion of the other.""

The official music video for the song came in the form of the official trailer for Astroworld, which was released to Scott's YouTube channel on July 30, 2018. It features the first half of the song and was directed by Nabil.

Was It 26 Lyrics
“Was It 26” is a cover of Charlie Daniels’s song of the same name composed by Don Sampson, which appeared on Daniels' album Simple Man.
[Verse 1]
Livin' hard was easy when I was young and bullet-proof
I had no chains to bind me, just a guitar and a roof
Emptied every bottle, when I poured I never missed
I had blood shot eyes at twenty-five or was it twenty-six
[Verse 2]
Didn't seem to matter what price I had to pay
'Cause anything worth havin', I’d just lose anyway
Friends worried about me they’d asked if I was sick
Thought I wouldn’t die at twenty-five or was it twenty-six
[Chorus]
Those two years run together like whiskey over ice
Meltin' into memories like somebody else's life
I’m glad to say, I’ve come around
But if I could have one wish
I’d like another try at twenty-five
Or was it twenty-six
[Verse 3]
Met a girl from Georgia, smart and pretty, college grad
I thought my luck was changin' but then it all went bad
I guess I fell in love with her all it took was just one kiss
But then she said goodbye at twenty-five or was it twenty-six[Chorus]
Those two years run together like whiskey over ice
Meltin' into memories like somebody else's life
I’m glad to say, I’ve come around
But if I could have one wish
I’d like another try at twenty-five
Or was it twenty-six
[Verse 4]
I've been down that road before almost as far as hell
Deception or redemption, I guess only time will tell
I have faith and the knowledge that God gave us a gift
I couldn't hide at twenty-five or was it twenty-six
[Chorus]
Those two years run together like whiskey over ice
Meltin' into memories like somebody else's life
I’m glad to say, I’ve come around
But if I could have one wish
I’d like another try at twenty-five
Or was it twenty-six",https://genius.com/Chris-stapleton-was-it-26-lyrics,"",""

The music video was filmed at the Piscina Municipal de Montjuïc in Barcelona, which hosted diving and water polo events at the 1992 Summer Olympics.

“Illusion was a song where I felt like lyrically, I got this radical optimism. I felt very strong in the moment when I was writing that song, because it was really seeing past someone’s bullshit, I guess, for lack of a better word. And understanding it for what it is and just entertaining it for the hell of it, even though you see what’s happening. When Kevin and Danny came together and it was the live drums and the synths and the big music breakdown, in my head the big dance moment, when all those came together it was just a feeling.”

In my dreams, I do anything I want to you
My emotions are naked, they're taking me out of my mind
[Chorus]
Right now, I'm shameless
Screamin' my lungs out for ya
Not afraid to face it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to
Show me you're shameless
Write it on my neck, why don't ya?
And I won't erase it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to
[Post-Chorus]
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now[Verse 2]
It's all there, now it's real
Now that you have me, do you want me still?
My kisses are history, they go back a long time, uh
And I'm tired of loving somebody that's not mine, no
[Pre-Chorus]
So many mornings I woke up confused
In my dreams, I do anything I want to you
My emotions are naked, they're taking me out of my mind (Mind)
[Chorus]
Right now, I'm shameless
Screamin' my lungs out for ya
Not afraid to face it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to
Show me you're shameless
Write it on my neck, why don't ya?
And I won't erase it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to
[Post-Chorus]
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now[Bridge]
Distance, inches in between us
I want you to give in, I want you to give in, oh
Weakness, tension in between us
I just wanna give in
And I don't care if I'm forgiven
[Chorus]
Right now, I'm shameless
Screamin' my lungs out for ya
Not afraid to face it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to
Show me you're shameless
Write it on my neck, why don't ya?
And I won't erase it
I need you more than I want to
I need you more than I want to

Artists such as Ray Charles, Ella Fitzgerald, Aretha Franklin, Little Richard, The Jackson 5 and Tina Turner all had their time on the Circuit.

“YA YA” is COWBOY CARTER’s most blatantly political statement, as Beyoncé embodies the titular character and speaks about the need to “keep the faith” in the face of the harsh realities of living in America. This song features a sample of Nancy Sinatra’s “These Boots Are Made for Walkin'” and alludes to numerous musical styles and dances from the 1950s and 60s, the height of legal segregation in the United States.

The song is currently only available on the digital version of the album and is not a part of the physical album tracklist. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Beyonc%C3%A9/_/YA+YA"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

[Verse 1]
How can it be? You and me
Might be meant to be, can't unsee it
But I don't wanna cause no scene
I'm usually so unproblematic
So independent, tell me why
'Cause the boy is mine, mine
[Pre-Chorus]
Somethin' about him is made for somebody like me
Baby, come over, come over (Over)
And God knows I'm tryin', but there's just no use in denying
[Chorus]
The boy is mine
I can't wait to try him
Le-let's get intertwined
The stars, they aligned
Thе boy is mine
Watch me take my timе
I can't believe my mind
The boy is divine
Boy is mine
[Verse 2]
Please know this ain't what I planned for
Probably wouldn't bet a dime or my life on
There's gotta be a reason why
My girls, they always come through in a sticky situation
Say, ""It's fine"" (It's fine)
Happens all the time[Pre-Chorus]

Baby, come over, come over (Over)
And God knows I'm tryin', but there's just no use in denying

I can't wait to try him
Le-let's get intertwined
The stars, they aligned
The boy is mine
Watch me take my time
I can't believe my mind
The boy is divine
Boy is—
[Bridge]
And I know it's simply meant to be
And I, I take full accountability for all these tears
Promise you, I'm not usually like this
Shit, it's like news to me, to me
But I can't ignore my heart, boy
[Chorus]
The boy is mine
I can't wait to try him (Oh, yeah)
Le-let's get intertwined
The stars, they aligned
The boy is mine
Watch me take my time
I can't believe my mind

[Verse 1]
Summer went away, still, the yearning stays
I play it cool with the best of them
I wait patiently, he's gonna notice me
It's okay, we're the best of friends
Anyway
I hear it in your voice, you're smoking with your boys
I touch my phone as if it's your face
I didn't choose this town, I dream of getting out
There's just one who could make me stay
All my days
[Pre-Chorus]
From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I waited ages to see you there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that you never cared
[Chorus]
You're on your own, kid
You always have been
[Verse 2]
I see the great escape,
 
so long, Daisy May
I picked the petals, he loves me not
Something different bloomed, writing in my room
I play my songs in the parking lot
I'll run away[Pre-Chorus]
From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I called a taxi to take me there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that my dreams aren't rare
[Chorus]
You're on your own, kid
You always have been
[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge]
From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I gave my blood, sweat, and tears for this
I hosted parties and starved my body
Like I'd be saved by a perfect kiss
The jokes weren't funny
, 
I took the money
My friends from home don't know what to say
I looked around in a blood-soaked gown
And I saw something they can't take away
'Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned
Everything you lose is a step you take
So, make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it
You've got no reason to be afraid[Chorus]
You're on your own, kid
Yeah, you can face this
You're on your own, kid

[Verse 1]
When the morning came
We were cleaning incense off your vinyl shelf
'Cause we lost track of time again
Laughing with my feet in your lap
Like you were my closest friend
""How'd we end up on the floor, anyway?"" you say
""Your roommate's cheap-ass screw-top rosé, that's how""
I see you every day now
[Chorus]
And I chose you
The one I was dancing with
In New York, no shoes
Looked up at the sky and it was
The burgundy on my t-shirt
When you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
So scarlet, it was
The mark thеy saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew bеtween telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon
[Verse 2]
When the silence came
We were shaking, blind and hazy
How the hell did we lose sight of us again?
Sobbing with your head in your hands
Ain't that the way shit always ends?
You were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway
Carnations you had thought were roses, that's us
I feel you, no matter what
The rubies that I gave up[Chorus]
And I lost you
The one I was dancing with
In New York, no shoes
Looked up at the sky and it was (Maroon)
The burgundy on my t-shirt
When you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
So scarlet, it was (Maroon)
The mark they saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon
[Bridge]
And I wake with your memory over me
That's a real fucking legacy, legacy (It was maroon)
And I wake with your memory over me
That's a real fucking legacy to leave
[Chorus]
The burgundy on my t-shirt
When you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
So scarlet, it was maroon
The mark they saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew between telephones

So scarlet, it was maroon[Outro]

After school, walking home
Fresh dirt under my fingernails and
I can smell hot asphalt
Cars screech to a halt to let me pass
And I cannot remember
What life was like through photographs
And trying to recreate
Images life gives us from our past
And sometimes it's a sad song
[Chorus]
But I cannot forget, refuse to regret
So glad I met you and
Take my breath away, make every day
Worth all of the pain that I've gone through
And mama, I've been crying
'Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said, ""The battle's almost won
And we're only several miles from the Sun""
Oh, whoa, oh, yeah
[Verse 2]
Now, moving on, down my street
I see people I won't ever meet
I think of her, take a breath
Feel the beat in the rhythm of my steps
Sometimes it's a sad song, oh[Chorus]
But I cannot forget, refuse to regret
So glad I met you and
Take my breath away, make every day
Worth all of the pain that I've gone through
And mama, I've been crying
'Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said, ""The battle's almost won
And we're only several miles from the Sun""
[Bridge]
The rhythm of her conversation
The perfection of her creation
The sex she slipped into my coffee
The way she felt when she first saw me
Hate to love and love to hate her
Like a broken record player
Back and forth and here and gone
And on and on and on and on
[Chorus]
I cannot forget, refuse to regret
So glad I met you, and
Take my breath away, make every day
Worth all of the pain that I've gone through
And mama, I've been crying
'Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said, ""The battle's almost won
And we're only several miles""
She said, ""The battle's almost won
And we're only several miles from the Sun""[Outro]
Yeah
Oh, oh
Several miles from the Sun, oh
Yeah
Woo!

[Verse 1]
I like to see everything in neon
Drink  lime green, stay up 'til dawn
Maybe  the way that I'm living is killing me
I like to light up the stage with a song
Do shit to keep me turned on
But  one day I woke up like
""Maybe  I'll do it differently""
[Pre-Chorus]
So I moved to California‚ but it's just a state of mind
It  turns out everywhere you go‚ you take yourself‚ that's not a lie
Wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
It's killing me slowly
[Chorus]
Dream a little dream of me
Make  me into something sweet
Turn the radio on, dancing to a pop song
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it‚ I love you
Fuck it, I love you
I really do
[Verse 2]
I used to shoot up my veins in neon
And shit's even brighter, you're gone
So many things I would say to you
I want you[Pre-Chorus]
You moved to California‚ but it's just a state of mind
And you know everyone adores you
You can't feel it and you're tired
Baby, wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
But it's killing me slowly
[Chorus]
Dream a little dream of me
Turn this into something sweet
Turn the radio on, dancing to a pop song
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it, I love you
I really do
[Bridge]
It turns out California's more than just a state of mind
I met you on the boulevard, wind through my hair, you blew my mind
And if I wasn't so fucked up, I think I'd fuck you all the time
(I really do)
It's killing me slowly
[Chorus]
Fuck it, I love you (I moved to California, but it's just a state of mind)
Fuck it, I love you 
(It turns out everywhere you go, you take yourself, that's not a lie)
Fuck it, I love you (Wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine)
I really do (It's killing me slowly)[Outro]

California dreamin'

got my money on my mind

Jazz is in my veins, running out of time

California dreamin', got my money on my mind

Jazz is in my veins

Nobody put that purpose in me like you do, still
Nobody get that work up out me like you do
Nobody get the truth up out me quite like you

Call me like you don't regret missin' this old thing back, call me
When you know the difference between me and chickens

The lyrics also reveal a struggle with self-worth, as SZA admits imperfections and the partner's role in defining a sense of purpose in herself. Towards the final verse, there's a shift suggesting a growing self-awareness and a call for her partner to recognize the consequences of their actions and how they'll regret to be without her.

You Belong With Me Lyrics
“You Belong with Me” tells the story of a boy who is too wrapped up in a toxic relationship to see how much another girl likes him. It appears on Taylor’s sophomore album, Fearless.

Taylor said the following…

[Verse 1]
You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
[Chorus]
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me
[Verse 2]
Walk in the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that can light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?[Pre-Chorus]
She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
[Chorus]
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time, how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me
[Bridge]
Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me
[Chorus]
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time, how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me[Outro]

It was released to US radio on April 20, 2009, as the third single from her second studio album, Fearless (2008). Inspired by a phone call between a member of her touring band and his girlfriend that she overheard, Swift wrote the song with Liz Rose to depict a narrator's unrequited love for a boy unappreciated by his girlfriend.

It was released to US radio on April 20, 2009, as the third single from her second studio album, Fearless (2008). Inspired by a phone call between a member of her touring band and his girlfriend that she overheard, Swift wrote the song with Liz Rose to depict a narrator's unrequited love for a boy unappreciated by his girlfriend. Swift and Nathan Chapman produced ""You Belong with Me"", which features a banjo-led production and incorporates fiddle, mandolin, and rock-influenced bass and electric guitars. Although the single was promoted to country radio by Big Machine Records, critics deemed it a pop song that stylistically aligns with 1980s subgenres such as pop rock and power pop.

When ""You Belong with Me"" was first released, critics praised the song's radio-friendly production and emotional engagement that appealed to a broad audience, although some deemed Swift's songwriting formulaic. At the 2010 Grammy Awards, ""You Belong with Me"" was nominated in three categories, including Song of the Year and Record of the Year. The single reached the top ten on charts and received sales certifications in Australia, Canada, Japan, and New Zealand. In the United States, it peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and was the first country song to reach number one on both Hot Country Songs and the all-genre Radio Songs chart. The single was certified seven times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

Roman White directed the song's music video, which stars Swift as both the antagonist—an unsympathetic, popular cheerleader, and the protagonist—a sympathetic girl-next-door who yearns for the antagonist's boyfriend; some critics took issue with the video's narrative as antifeminist. At the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, where ""You Belong with Me"" won Best Female Video, rapper Kanye West interrupted Swift's acceptance speech, which caused a controversy widely covered by the media. Following the 2019 dispute regarding the ownership of Swift's back catalog, she re-recorded the song as ""You Belong with Me (Taylor's Version)"" for her re-recorded album Fearless (Taylor's Version) (2021). ""You Belong with Me"" was included on the set lists of five of her headlining tours. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Swift/_/You+Belong+with+Me"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In a ranking of all songs on the album for Billboard, Stephen Daw placed it second, calling the track an ""A+ pop gem"" as well as a conglomeration of ""all the sounds that have helped make Gaga the icon that she is"".[7] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian viewed the song as an example of ""the fleeting clubland hook-up as balm for the soul"".[8] Vogue editor Christian Allaire called it one of the album's two ""sexy pop bangers certain to be hits in all the gay clubs"".[9] In a review for Pitchfork, Walden Green praised the track on which ""Gaga invokes MDMA, nine-inch stilettos, and some good old-fashioned blasphemy, envisioning the site of original sin as a warehouse rave with God in the DJ booth.""[10]

Alexa Camp at Slant Magazine thought the track was ""an attempt to revive the messy party-girl shtick"" hailing from The Fame with a ""shamelessness of someone half her age"".[4] Variety's Steven J. Horowitz went as far as saying the song was ""so aligned with that aesthetic"" that it could have appeared on either The Fame or The Fame Monster (2009).[6] ""Garden of Eden"" debuted at number 31 on the Billboard Global 200. In the United States, it reached number 52 on the Billboard Hot 100 and peaked at number 3 on the Hot Dance/Pop Songs chart. The song also charted in over 25 countries, including number 4 in New Zealand, number 11 in Japan, number 23 in the United Kingdom, number 31 in Ireland, and number 43 in Canada.[11] Gaga's first live performance of ""Garden of Eden"" was during her headlining set at Coachella 2025, which saw the whole stage turning green and Gaga playing guitar for the song.[12][13] NME noted the track was ""given an operatic revamp"".[14] <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Lady+Gaga/_/Garden+of+Eden"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In an interview, Harry Styles, who co-wrote the song, discussed its meaning. After defining “Stockholm Syndrome”, he explained that they applied the idea of the psychological phenomenon to a relationship–“of actually,” as Zayn added, “enjoying the feeling of being trapped,” with Harry clarifying, “to a nympho.” When the interviewer suggested that the song was a reflection of the band “feeling trapped” within their circumstances, Liam dismissed this (decidedly more PG) interpretation, and Harry insisted, “This song was more about, like, a nympho.”

“Nympho” is colloquial shorthand for the term “nymphomaniac,” which is defined as “a woman who has abnormally excessive and uncontrollable sexual desire.” <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/One+Direction/_/Stockholm+Syndrome"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Rain To Be (English Ver.) Lyrics
[Verse 1: Yonghoon]
I looked up at the sky, silent with no words
Sending my signs to you, with folded hands
If I see you, if I could see you
Flowers will bloom on this barren land
[Pre-Chorus: Dongmyeong]
The peace before typhoon falls to ground
I whisper to break the silence
In the end, to find you who fill here all around
[Chorus: Yonghoon]
And it's starting to rain
Looked out the window then
You're already waiting for me over there
Heaven, please hear my pray
Don't wanna lose you again
A fateful encounter
For the inevitable lovе we have

Na-na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na

Dongmyeong

The days I'm dying to see your facе
Always used to soak down this place
For me, you always opened the ground
That is in middle of the road of dawn
Raindrop's falling and flowing through my collars
Seeping with all of my memories
The days I meet with you will always be
It will be in the place where raindrop falls down[Pre-Chorus: Yonghoon]
My heart is just waiting for you and
Fills up as it reaches the sky
To find you here in this place all around
[Chorus: Dongmyeong]
And it's starting to rain
Looked out the window then
You're already waiting for me over there
Heaven, please hear my pray
Don't wanna lose you again

뚝뚝뚝뚝
Finally, sun shower begins to rain
Took a glance at the raindrops on my shoulder for nothing
뚝뚝뚝뚝
Now reflected on the water
Hidden deeply my February inside the veil of this world[Bridge: Yonghoon]
The days when I'm dying to see your face
I used to wait for the rain to begin
Though it may be a twinkle of an eye
If I could place you in my eyes, don't mind

Dongmyeong

And it's starting to rain
Looked out the window then
You're already waiting for me over there

Na-na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na

The place that I will go
You already look at me with a smile again

[Intro: Kanye West]
You just popped in the Kanye West
Get Right for the Summer

And ladies, if you follow these instructions exactly
You might be able to pull you a rapper, a NBA player
Man, at least a dude with a car!
So, first of all, we gonna work on the stomach
Nobody wants a little tight ass
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
One, and two, and three, and four, and get them sit ups right, and
Tuck your 
tummy tight
 and do your crunches like this
Give head, stop, breathe, get up, check your weave
Don't drop the blunt and disrespect the weed
Pick up your son, don't disrespect your seed
It's a party tonight and ooh, she's so excited
Tell me who's invited:

Henny make girls look like Halle Berry to me
So excuse me, miss, I forgot your name
Thank you, God bless you, good night I came, I came, I came

[Verse 1]
It's second nature to walk home before the sun goes down
And put your keys between your knuckles when there's boys around
Isn't it funny how we laugh it off to hide our fear
When there's nothing funny here? (Ah)
Sick intuition that they taught us, so we won't freak out
We hide our figures, doing anything to shut their mouths
We smile away to ease the tension so it don't go south
But there's nothing funny now (Ah)
[Pre-Chorus]
When will we stop saying things
'Cause they're all listening?
No, the kids ain't alright
Oh, and they do what they see
'Cause it's all on TV
Oh, the kids ain't alright
[Chorus]
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women[Verse 2]
I'm sure if there's something that I can't find the words to say
I know that there will be a man around to save the day
And that was sarcasm, in case you needed it mansplained
I should've stuck to ballet (Ah)
[Pre-Chorus]
When will we stop saying things
'Cause they're all listening?
No, the kids ain't alright
Oh, and they do what they see
'Cause it's all on TV
Oh, the kids ain't alright

But girls will be women

But girls will be women

If you're offended by this song
You're clearly doing something wrong
If you're offended by this song
Then you're probably saying
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women[Pre-Chorus]
When will we stop saying things
'Cause they're all listening?
No, the kids ain't alright
Oh, and they do what they see

It is a baroque pop and chamber pop ballad set to orchestral strings and marching band drums with backing vocals from the Stagecoach Epsom Performing Arts Choir. Intending to start a conversation with the song, ""Boys Will Be Boys"" has themes of feminism and addresses the growing pains girls experience, needing to grow up faster than boys. She condemns toxic masculinity and how society treats women as inferior.

Several critics commended the message and lyrics of ""Boys Will Be Boys"" however many found it to be too unlike other tracks on ""Future Nostalgia"" and thought that Lipa did not get her point across correctly. The song appeared on year-end lists published by The New York Times and Nylon while commercially peaking at number 78 in Lithuania and 148 in Portugal. A remix of the song by Zach Witness that samples ""Think (About It)"" by Lyn Collins appears on Lipa and the Blessed Madonna's remix album ""Club Future Nostalgia"". The latter musician played the remix at Lipa's Studio 2054 livestream concert while Lipa performed the song at the 2020 Billboard Women in Music ceremony.

Dua Lipa has often used her platform to advocate for issues she believes in, including feminism; of that she usually mentioned female equality in the workplace. The singer condemned the use of the term ""boys will be boys"" in a 2018 interview with GQ. ""Boys Will Be Boys"" was written by Lipa, Kennedi, Justin Tranter and Jason Evigan, while the production was handled by Koz. The song came about during a studio session between Lipa and the team she created ""Physical"" with, when they began talking about Lipa's experiences with men growing up as a female. The singer felt compelled to write the song as it stems from personal experiences and growing pains she faced and after talking about them with her friends and seeing posts on social media, she realized they were universal. These experiences revolved around her feeling powerless or intimidated in public spaces and doing things to avoid sexual harassment, catcalling and confrontation from men. Some of the experiences included putting keys through her knuckles, covering up her body, pretending as if she is on the phone with someone while walking alone, walking home before nightfall, self-policing friends by making sure she knew their location at all times and vice versa, and several other coping mechanisms. Lipa stated that she never thought twice about these experiences and thought they were just something she had to do.

With ""Boys Will Be Boys"", Lipa desired to start a conversation about issues women and girls face and how they change themselves to fit the lifestyle of men. She stated that much of women's human experience revolves around men and how they make them feel. The singer described that girls are made to feel uncomfortable at a young age with being taught that the way boys treat them is normal and playing a school game such as ""Kiss Chase"". She continued by explaining that it is difficult to change once one has a fixed mindset, so if young listeners could ask questions about these issues are if they are talked about in school, it would make a great impact on society. Additionally, Lipa confirmed that she did not want to offend anyone or point any fingers but she wanted the lyrics to be ""cutting"" for the sake of the conversation. She also wanted to show solidarity with other girls to express comfort that it happens to all girls. ""Boys Will Be Boys"" was recorded at Masterlink Studios in Surrey, RAK Studios in London and Modulator Music in Toronto while the vocals were recorded at TaP Studio in London. The mixing was handled by Jay Reynolds at Long Island Studios and the mixing was done by Chris Gehringer at Sterling Sound in Edgewater, New Jersey. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Dua+Lipa/_/Boys+Will+Be+Boys"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

[Intro]
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
[Verse 1]
You and I go hard at each other like we're going to war
You and I go rough, we keep throwing things and slamming the doors
You and I get so damn dysfunctional, we stopped keeping score
You and I get sick, yeah, I know that we can't do this no more
[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah but baby, there you go again, there you go again
Making me love you
Yeah, I stopped using my head, using my head
Let it all go
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo
And now I'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid crawling back to you
[Chorus]
So I cross my heart, and I hope to die
That I'll only stay with you one more night
And I know I've said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night
[Verse 2]
Try to tell you ""no,"" but my body keeps on telling you ""yes""
Try to tell you ""stop,"" but your lipstick got me so out of breath
I'll be waking up in the morning, probably hating myself
And I'll be waking up, feeling satisfied, but guilty as hell[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah but baby, there you go again, there you go again
Making me love you (Making me love you)
Yeah, I stopped using my head, using my head
Let it all go (Let it all go)
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo (Like a tattoo, yeah)
And now I'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid crawling back to you
[Chorus]
So I cross my heart, and I hope to die (Yeah)
That I'll only stay with you one more night (Oh)
And I know I've said it a million times (Yeah)
But I'll only stay with you one more night (Yeah)

Yeah, yeah[Chorus]
So I cross my heart, and I hope to die (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)

Nothing but a tear, that's all for breakfast
Watching you pretend you're unaffected
You're pulling our connections, expecting me to let you go
But I won't

I know you don't need my protection
But I'm in love, can't blame me for checking

Close to you
Like so close if they hurt you, you wouldn't find out
Just say now, I'm coming right now to be close to you

Said you let it go, you kept it
Working hard to perfect it
But now your fear is reckless, and it's out of your control

There's a glow off the pavement
You walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parkin' lot, yeah
Oh, yeah

We're driving down the road

In a storm, in my best dress, fearless

 I wanna stay right here

In this moment now, capture it, remember it[Chorus]

Special Lyrics
On “Special,“ SZA discusses her own insecurities and regrets about a man, which is also a recurring theme on her debut album, Ctrl.
[Verse 1]
I wish I was that girl from the Gucci store
She never wore any makeup and she owns couture
I got pimples where my beauty marks should be
I got dry skin on my elbows and knees
I never liked her, wanted to be like her
Hate how you look at her 'cause you never saw me
Like I was an art piece, like I was an ordinary girl
[Chorus]
I wish I was special
I gave all my special
Away to a loser
Now I'm just a loser
I used to be special
But you made me hate me
Regret that I changed me
I hate that you made me
Just like you
Just like you
[Verse 2]
I wanted to be thick, now I wanna be thin
Heard Pilates is in
, bash your windows out
You gon' hear my mouth, you could kick me out
You say I'm too wild, you gon' hate me now
Boy, you got me fucked up, now I'm gettin' fucked up
Thinkin' 'bout us fucking, why you'd have to fuck her?
I don't wanna see you, why'd you have to treat me
Like I was an ordinary girl?[Chorus]
I wish I was special
I gave all my special
Away to a loser
Now I'm just a loser
I used to be special
But you made me hate me
Regret that I changed me
I hate that you made me

E.T.A. Lyrics
“E.T.A.” was first previewed in Justin’s documentary series Justin Bieber: Seasons, which was released to YouTube on January 27, 2020.
[Verse 1]
Feels like time's moving in slow motion
Just trying to occupy my mind
So that I don't go looney over you (Ooh-ooh)
Just trying to amplify the sound
To drown out all of this need for you (You, ooh)
Biting my nails, got me nervous, so anxious
See it's one o'clock now
Noon felt like three hours ago
[Chorus]
I just wanna know your E.T.A., E.T.A.​
Out the window, got me looking out the street
What's your E.T.A.?
Distance only made us grow fonder
Of one another
Be honest, what's your E.T.A.?
What's your E.T.A.?
[Verse 2]
Say you almost right here now
Just say you pulling up to my gate
Don't say the signal faded driving through the canyon
Just hurry up for my sake
I was born ready for you
Skin sweeter than cinnamon
Eyes deeper than the ocean
Love me hard like, ""Where you been?""
Love me like you don't want it to end[Chorus]
I just wanna know your E.T.A., E.T.A.​
Out the window, got me looking out the street
What's your E.T.A.?
Distance only made us grow fonder
Of one another
Be honest, what's your E.T.A.?
What's your E.T.A.?

Before you gotta go
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Before you gotta go
Drop a pin for me now
So I can learn your location

Only place I wanna be

[Verse 1]
Yes, I'm gonna stay with him tonight
I’ll see you in the mornin'
No, of course he won't drink and drive
Can you say bye to mom for me?
Oh, you’ll like him, he's really kind
And he's funny like you sometimes
And I found someone I really like
Maybe for the first time
[Pre-Chorus]
No, I don't need a jacket
It's not that cold tonight
And you worry, I get it
But he's waitin' outside
[Chorus]
I swear on my heart that he's a good man
I know you’ll stay up late just waitin’ for me
You held me so tight, now someone else can
But you were the first man that really loved me
[Verse 2]
Now you're driving to the airport
Not just me you pick up anymore
I’ve got eight days off comin' up
And I can only come home for four[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I just met his family
They're just like you and mom (Oh)
He makes me really happy
I think he might be the one, oh
[Chorus]
I swear on my heart that he's a good man
I promise he loves me, he’d never hurt me
You held me so tight, now someone else can
But you were the first man that really loved me
Now you're on the driveway, faking a smile
You wish you could tell him he doesn't deserve me
So I had to stop the car and turn around
To tell you you were the first man that really loved me
[Post-Chorus]
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah
[Bridge]
And before they open up the doors
I say, ""I've never seen you cry before""
You say, ""You've never looked so beautiful
You know you'll always be my little girl""[Chorus]
You're looking at me while walking down the aisle
With tears in your eyes, maybe he deserves me
You don't even know how much it means to me now
That you were the first man that really loved me
Oh, really loved me
Oh, you really love me",https://genius.com/Camila-cabello-first-man-lyrics,"In “First Man”, Camila sings directly to her father, Alejandro, trying to ease his worry about the relationship she was in. Camila revealed that “First Man” was the first song written for Romance, in Nashville. She added:

[Intro]
Money is the anthem of success
So before we go out, what's your address?
[Verse 1]
I'm your national anthem
God, you're so handsome
Take me to the Hamptons,
 
Bugatti Veyron
He loves to romance 'em
Reckless abandon
Holdin' me for ransom, upper echelon
He says to be cool, but I don't know how yet
Wind in my hair, hand on the back of my neck
I said, ""Can we party later on?"" He said, ""Yes"" (Yes, yes)
[Chorus]
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Booyah, baby, bow down, makin' me say wow now)
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Sugar, sugar, how? Now take your body downtown)
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem[Post-Chorus]
Money is the reason we exist
Everybody knows it, it's a fact (Kiss, kiss)
[Verse 2]
I sing the national anthem
While I am standin' over your body
Hold you like a python
And you can't keep your hands off me or your pants on
See what you've done to me, King of Chevron?
He said to be cool, but I'm already coolest
I said to get real, don't you know who you're dealin' with?
Um, do you think you'll buy me lots of diamonds?
(
""Yes, of course I will, my darling""
)
[Chorus]
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Booyah, baby, bow down, makin' me say wow now)
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Sugar, sugar, how? Now take your body downtown)
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem
[Bridge]
It's a love story for the new age
For the sixth page
We're on a quick, sick rampage
Winin' and dinin', drinkin' and drivin'
Excessive buyin',
 
overdose and dyin'
On our drugs and our love and our dreams and our rage
Blurring the lines between real and the fake
Dark and lonely, I need somebody to hold me
He will do very well, I can tell, I can tell
Keep me safe in his belltower hotel
Money is the anthem of success
So put on mascara and your party dress[Verse 3]
I'm your national anthem
Boy, put your hands up
Give me a standin' ovation
Boy, you have landed
Babe, in the land of
Sweetness and danger, Queen of Saigon
[Chorus]
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Booyah, baby, bow down, makin' me say wow now)
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Sugar, sugar, how? Now take your body downtown)
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem

When I'm in my thoughts sometimes
It's hard to believe I'm the person you think I am

I'm on my ten thousandth life
Nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine slipped my hands

Somewhere in the sky (Yeah), the way your body fits on mine
And when you give in to me, I'm so high, but I'm fallin' (Na-na-na)
And now my eyes are locked on you (Yeah), as you dance around the room (Yeah)
And finally, I'm right where I belong (Oh)

I feel like I don't deserve you tonight (I don't deserve you)
It's in the way that you hold me

Born Here Live Here Die Here Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Bunch of buddies in John Deere hats
A little crazy, but they got my back
Know every roll-through stop sign  like the back of my hand
And every bank where the fish will bite
Still like putting a smile on the face
Of a girl I've known since the second grade
Got a kiss that's sweet like lemonade
She's everything I'll ever need
Another reason I'll never leave
[Chorus]
Born here, live here, die here
From the roots, to the boots, to the lay me down suit
Yeah, I'm gonna be proud to be right here
Just like my daddy, and his daddy did too
Ride the same roads, work the same dirt
Go to the same church and drink the same beer
Born here, live here, die here
Yeah
[Verse 2]
Everybody's gotta find their place
Some dreams you catch, some dreams you chase
Some people run and some people stay
Me, I'll always be[Chorus]
A born here, live here, die here
From the roots, to the boots, to the lay me down suit
Yeah, I'm gonna be proud to be right here
Just like my daddy, and his daddy did too
Ride the same roads, work the same dirt
Go to the same church and drink the same beer
Born here, live here, die here
Yeah

I'm gonna raise one up in the air tonight
For all the folks like me

We'll ride the same roads, work the same dirt
Go to the same church and drink the same beer

[Verse 1]
Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter 'cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in, turn on your favourite nightlight
[Pre-Chorus]
To you, everything's funny
You got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have, honey
If you could stay like that
[Chorus]
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
And no one will desert you
Just try to never grow up
[Post-Chorus]
Never grow up
[Verse 2]
You're in the car, on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
At fourteen, there's just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots[Pre-Chorus]
But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's gettin' older, too
And don't lose the way that you dance around
In your PJs getting ready for school
[Chorus]
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
No one's ever burned you
Nothing's ever left you scarred
And even though you want to
Just try to never grow up
[Bridge]
Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is, someday, gonna be gone
[Verse 3]
So, here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on[Chorus]
Wish I'd never grown up
I wish I'd never grown up
Oh, I don't wanna grow up
Wish I'd never grown up, I could still be little
Oh, I don't wanna grow up
Wish I'd never grown up, it could still be simple
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darlin', don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you (Never grow up)
Won't let no one break your heart
And even though you want to
Please, try to never grow up

Don't you ever grow up
Oh (Never grow up)
Just never grow up",https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-never-grow-up-lyrics,"Taylor Swift explains the story behind ""Never Grow Up"" on her official website:

""Never Grow Up"" is a song about the fact that I don't quite know how I feel about growing up. It's tricky. Growing up happens without you knowing it. Growing up is such a crazy concept because a lot of times when you were younger you wish you were older.

[Intro: Dev]
I wanna get you by yourself, yeah, have you to myself
I don't need nobody else, don't want nobody else
He's special, I know
His smile, it glows
He's perfect, it shows
Let's go

I've been staring at you
And I could do it all night
You're looking like an angel with that kind of body
Needs a spotlight
[Pre-Chorus: Demi Lovato]
Ain't nobody know your name
But looking like you do, could be famous
I could see us making waves
From the back of the club, to a bed in the shade, now

I don't know who you are, but you look like a star
And everybody here be thinking
Who's that boy?
Wanna take you home and get you all alone
And everybody here is thinking
Who's that boy?[Post-Chorus: Demi Lovato]
Oh, he got me
No, I've never seen no one like him
Damn, he's everything
Girls, they want him
Guys, they wanna be
Who's that boy?
Who's that boy?
[Verse 2: Demi Lovato]
You could say that I'm distracted
At how you got me so attracted
But boy, I tell you what the fact is
Is no one else in this room that could rock it like you, you do
[Pre-Chorus: Demi Lovato]
Ain't nobody know your name
But looking like you do, could be famous
I could see us making waves
From the back of the club, to a bed in the shade, now

Guys, they wanna be

Who's that boy?
[Bridge: Demi Lovato]
Everybody in the club turn around saying
Who's that?
Who's that?
Beautiful boy with them big brown eyes
Tell me, who's that?
Who's that?
[Verse 3: Dev]
I got my eye on this boy
Can't get him off my mind
He's one of a kind
The cherry to my pie
I just wanna get him close
Want to make him mine
Come hold my hand and dance away the night
Give me the green light, kiss my lips
Who's that boy watching my hips?
I-I-I wanna know who you are
My name is Dev and you can be my star[Chorus: Demi Lovato]

Loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated
[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
I place blame on you still, place shame on you still
Feel like you ain't shit, feel like you don't feel
Confidence in yourself, breakin' on marble floors
Watchin' anonymous strangers, tellin' me that I'm yours
But you ain't shit, I'm convinced your tolerance nothin' special
What can I blame you for? Nigga, I can name several
Situations, I'll start with your little sister bakin'
A baby inside, just a teenager, where your patience?
Where was your antennas?
Where was the influence you speak of?
You preached in front of one-hundred-thousand but never reached her
I fuckin' tell you, you fuckin' failure, you ain't no leader
I never liked you, forever despise you, I don't need you
The world don't need you, don't let them deceive you
Numbers lie too, fuck your pride too, that's for dedication
Thought money would change you, made you more complacent
Fuckin' hate you, I hope you embrace it[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I swear, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated
[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar, 
SZA & Bilal
]
Lovin' you, lovin' you, not lovin' you, 100 proof
I can feel your vibe and recognize that you're ashamed of me
Yes, I hate you, too
[Part II]
[Intro: Jessica Vielmas & 
Whoarei

(
Loving you ain't really complicated
)
Housekeeping, housekeeping
(
What I got to do to get to you?

¡Abre la puerta! ¡Abre la puerta, tengo que limpiar el cuarto!

To you

¡Es que no hay mucho tiempo! ¡Tengo que limpiar el cuarto!

Loving you ain't really complicated

¡Disculpe!

To you
)[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
And you the reason why mom and them leavin'
No, you ain't shit, you say you love 'em, I know you don't mean it
I know you irresponsible, selfish, in denial, can't help it
Your trials and tribulations a burden, everyone felt it
Everyone heard it, multiple shots, corners cryin' out
You was deserted, where was your antennas again?
Where was your presence? Where was your support that you pretend?
You ain't no brother, you ain't no disciple, you ain't no friend
A friend never leave Compton for profit,
 or leave his best friend, 
little brother
You promised you'd watch him before they shot him
Where was your antennas? On the road, bottles and bitches
You FaceTimed him one time, that's unforgiven
You even FaceTimed instead of a hospital visit
Guess you thought he'd recover well
Third surgery, they couldn't stop the bleeding for real
Then he died, God himself will say, ""You fuckin' failed,"" you ain't try
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I know your secrets, nigga, mood swings is frequent, nigga
I know depression is restin' on your heart for two reasons, nigga
I know you and a couple block boys ain't been speakin', nigga
Y'all damn near beefin', I see it and you're the reason, nigga
And if this bottle could talk
I cry myself to sleep, bitch, everything is your fault
Faults breakin' to pieces, earthquakes on every weekend
Because you shook as soon as you knew confinement was needed
I know your secrets, don't let me tell 'em to the world about that shit you thinkin'
And that time that— I'm 'bout to hurl
I'm fucked up, but I ain't as fucked up as you
You just can't get right, I think your heart made of bullet proof
Should've killed yo' ass long time ago
You should've felt that black revolver blast a long time ago
And if these mirrors could talk, it'll say, ""You gotta go""
And if I told your secrets, the world'll know money can't stop a suicidal weakness",https://genius.com/Kendrick-lamar-u-lyrics,"The sixth track on Lamar’s third album, “u” acts as a complete contrast to its lead single “i,” an anthem of peace, positivity, and prosperity starting with self-love.

In addition to breaking the track down with MTV, in an interview with Rolling Stone, Lamar said the following about the record:

""That was one of the hardest songs I had to write. There are some very dark moments in there. All my insecurities and selfishness and let-downs. That shit is depressing as a motherfucker. But it helps, though. It helps.""

Anybody reading or listening who may be asking these questions of themselves, just remember: from “u,” you will eventually reach “i.”

In The Oral History of Kendrick Lamar’s ‘To Pimp a Butterfly’, Kendrick’s engineer MixedByAli described the recording of the song:

""[The] session for “U” was very uncomfortable. [Lamar] wrote it in the booth. The mic was on and I could hear him walking back and forth and having these super angry vocals. Then he’d start recording with the lights off and it was super emotional. I never asked what got into him that day.""

On New Year’s Eve 2015, T.D.E. posted a video on their Vimeo user called: “Kendrick Lamar – God Is Gangsta”. This video is a 2-part music video for “u” and “For Sale?”. T.D.E.’s verified Vimeo user was made specifically for this video. The video would later be posted on Youtube on January 13th of the next year.

[Verse 1]
I bet this time of night, you’re still up
I bet you’re tired from a long, hard week
I bet you’re sittin' in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city, and I bet
Sometimes, you wonder 'bout me
[Chorus]
And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don’t, I almost do, I almost do
[Verse 2]
I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
‘Cause each time you reach out, there’s no reply
I bet it never, ever occurred to you
That I can’t say hello to you and risk another goodbye
[Chorus]
And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don’t, I almost do, I almost do[Bridge]
Oh, we made quite a mess, babe
It’s probably better off this way
And I confess, babe
In my dreams, you’re touching my face
And asking me if I want to try again with you
And I almost do

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you

So you’re sitting there and wondering where they are and hope that they think about you and that you’re almost picking up the phone call, but you just can’t. I think I needed to write this song in order to not call that person actually. I think that writing the song was what I did instead of picking up the phone.

The same relationship she wrote this song about left her so emotional that she suffered six months of writing block prior to being able to begin writing Red, as she mentioned to USA Today.

There’s a kind of bad that gets so overpowering you can’t even write about it. When you feel pain that is so far past dysfunctional, that leaves you with so many emotions that you can’t filter them down to simple emotions to write about. That’s when you know you really need to get out.

For a Boat Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Everything I learned about life
I learned out on that bank
From gettin' up early, comin' up empty
And good things come to those that wait
Money doesn't grow on trees
The difference in talking and shootin' the breeze
[Chorus]
I remember thinkin', wouldn't it be cool
To have an old flat bottom and an Evinrude?
And Daddy saying, ""Son, don't they bite just fine right here?""
He'd say, ""Love what you got, buddy, not what you ain't""
And just about then that bobber would sink
And that outboard dream of mine would disappear
I grew up pretty lucky as far as lucky goes
Too broke for a boat
[Verse 2]
He could've picked up an extra shift
Or a weekend at the factory
But every Sunday was saved for Jesus
And Saturdays, he spent with me
'Til that summer would fall
I didn't know we had it all[Chorus]
I remember thinkin', wouldn't it be cool
To have an old flat bottom and an Evinrude?
And Daddy saying, ""Son, don't they bite just fine right here?""
He'd say, ""Love what you got, buddy, not what you ain't""
And just about then that bobber would sink
And that outboard dream of mine would disappear
I grew up pretty lucky as far as lucky goes
Too broke for a boat
Too broke for a boat

Too Drunk to Drive Lyrics
[Verse 1]
There ain't a liquor store, dive bar, or corner booth for twenty miles around
We ain't on a boat, on a lake, in the sun with the cooler loaded down
But suddenly, I'm feeling all impaired from the way you looked at me from over there
Rolling like I'm stoned past gone, looking in your eyes
[Chorus]
Girl, I'm too, I'm too, I'm too drunk to drive
What do I do with you? Let's lay low tonight
Got me high, got me right, got me flying 'cause you're looking so fine
I ain't had no shot, ain't drank a drop
But I'm too drunk to drive
[Verse 2]
You can hide my keys, lock the door, maybe we can find something here to do
Maybe wreck some sheets, crash your lips into mine and not even make the news
These four walls are safer than them two lanes
You pour 'em tall when you start whispering my name
Ain't no blue light, line walkin' happening tonight
[Chorus]
Girl, I'm too, I'm too, I'm too drunk to drive
What do I do with you? Let's lay low tonight
Got me high, got me right, got me flying 'cause you're looking so fine
I ain't had no shot, ain't drank a drop
But I'm too drunk to drive
Yeah, I'm too drunk to drive[Chorus]
Yeah, girl, I'm too, I'm too, I'm too drunk to drive
What do I do with you? Let's lay low tonight
Got me high, got me right, got me flying 'cause you're looking so fine
I ain't had no shot, ain't drank a drop
But I'm too drunk to drive
No, I ain't had a shot, ain't drank a drop

And the violence caused such silence

Gone Girl Lyrics
On the tenth track of SOS, SZA references the critically acclaimed psychological crime thriller “Gone Girl” and channels its themes of love, relationships, and abandonment.
[Intro]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Split mind, don't need to decide when
Straightforward, eyes on the climbin'
I decide no matter the climate
Birthin' bitches in my third trimester
Shift eyes, they tell me you lyin'
Don't care, just lay here beside me
Hang time chasin' the rewind
Hang time
[Pre-Chorus]
I need more space and security (Security)
I need less voices, just you and me (Just you and me)
I need your touch, not your scrutiny (Scrutiny)
Squeezin' too tight, boy, you're losin' me
Boy, you're losin'
[Chorus]
Gone, gone, girl, gonе, girl
You better learn how to facе it
She's gone, gone, girl, so gone, girl
Never replace her
She's gone, gone, girl, gone, girl
You better learn how to face it
She's gone, gone, girl, so gone, girl[Verse 2]
Can't think, it's too hard to process
Get around you and I regress
I decide what demons I digest
I'm just tired of repeatin', I digress
Tryna find deeper meanin' in nonsense
Tryna grow without hatin' the process
Tired of anticipating the worst yet
Still anticipating the worst (Worst
)
[Pre-Chorus]
I need more space and security (Security)
I need less voices, just you and me (You and me)
I need your touch, not your scrutiny (Scrutiny)
Squeezin' too tight, boy, you're losin' me
Boy, you're losin'
[Chorus]
Gone, gone, girl, gone, girl
You better learn how to face it
She's gone, gone, girl, so gone, girl
Never replace her
She's gone, gone, girl, gone, girl
You better learn how to face it
She's gone, gone, girl, so gone, girl[Bridge]
Inward I go when there's no one around me
And memories drown me, the further I go
And ain't nobody talkin' 'bout the damage, pretendin' like it's all okay
I tried to erase, I live to escape
[Chorus]
Gone, gone, girl, gone, girl
You better learn how to face it
She's gone, gone, girl, so gone, girl

NC-17 was formerly known as “X-Rated.” The reason the song is titled after this rating is due to the explicit lyrics of the track. This also relates to the theme of ASTROWORLD sounding like a theme park, as many theme park rides and attractions have age restrictions. According to the MPAA, the NC-17 rating signifies “Clearly adult. Children are not admitted.”

In a now-deleted Instagram story, Travis posted the title of this song along with “NO BYSTANDERS,” “STARGAZING,” and “STOP TRYING TO BE GOD” to promote the album.

Prior to the release of the album, “NC-17” was one of only two songs (excluding the already released “BUTTERFLY EFFECT”) previewed by Travis, with the other being “STARGAZING.” It was first shown off by Travis' friend, Oggizery Los, on his Instagram story before later being played at a club by Travis shortly after. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Travis+Scott/_/NC-17"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

You're talking shit for the hell of it
Addicted to betrayal, but you're relevant
You're terrified to look down
'Cause if you dare, you'll see the glare
Of everyone you burned just to get there
It's coming back around
[Pre-Chorus]
And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldn't know what I mean
[Chorus]
'Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that

Spiderboy, king of thieves
Weave your little webs of opacity
My pennies made your crown
Trick me once, trick me twice

Ask me what I learned from all those years
Ask me what I earned from all those tears
Ask me why so many fade, but I'm still here

Rattling your ground
Karma's on your scent like a bounty hunter
Karma's gonna track you down

Sweet like justice, karma is a queen
Karma takes all my friends to the summit
Karma is the guy on the screen
Coming straight home to me[Chorus]

Overall, the song holds a strong message about how our karma — or the consequences of our decisions — will always be present and cannot be avoided. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Swift/_/Karma"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Without Your Love Lyrics
[Introduction]
[Verse 1]
Yesterday just came and went
And today dealt me another hand of heartaches that I'll play
What we said and what we meant
Two different things, just some words and rings
And time keeps raising the stakes
[Verse 2]
Tonight I'll find you in my dreams
And tomorrow I'll wake up and have to feel you fade away
That's the way it goes it seems
Tears filled with pain and they fall like rain
Constant reminders every day
[Chorus]
Without your love
The sky is grey
Without your love
I'm waiting on the sun to shine
Without your love
Every hour is the darkest time of day
And every moment's a crime
And every moment's a crime[Bridge]
The more I live without you
Just can't forget about you
Nobody else can set me free
Baby, please come back to me
Baby, please come back to me
[Chorus]
Without your love
The sky is grey
Without your love
I'm just waiting on the sun to shine
Without your love
Every hour is the darkest time of day
And every moment's a crime
Without your love
And every moment's a crime
Without your love
And I'm just doing my time
Without your love
And every moment's a crime",https://genius.com/Chris-stapleton-without-your-love-lyrics,"",""

[Intro: Take A Daytrip]
(Hey!)
[Verse 1]
Yeah, let's get to the point here
You love to disappoint me, don't ya?
You tell me what I want, but ain't no follow through
You don't follow through, no
But if you only knew me
The way you know my body, baby
Then I think maybe we could probably see this through
We could make it through, but
[Pre-Chorus]
I've been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist
[Chorus]
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please, come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed[Post-Chorus]
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed
[Verse 2]
I dedicate this verse to (Verse to)
All that good pipe in the moonlight
In the long nights where we did everything but talk it through
That's what we do, yeah (Oh)
You always let me down, boy (Oh, oh)
But when you're going down, I get so up (So up)
Don't know if I can find someone who do me like you do
[Pre-Chorus]
I've been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist (Ah-ha)
[Chorus]
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please (Please), come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed[Post-Chorus]
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed (That's what makes us)
It's bad (Oh-oh)
We drive each other mad (Oh-oh)
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed (That's what)
[Bridge]
(Ah)
Yeah, we don't know how to talk (Mmm)
But damn, we know how to fuck
[Chorus]
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad (Ah)
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head (Messing with my head)
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please (Oh, please), come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed (That's what makes us good in bed)

I guess this song does what it says on the tin: It’s about when good sex is the only thing that was holding two people together. It was very fun to get to make a song like this and to be so carefree and open. Those relationships never last; it’s a cautionary tale.""

Look at you go
Walkin' on everyone like steppin' stones
Buildin' a home made up of gold
Of people you hurt
Bridges to Hollywood you took, then burned
I hope it was worth it, what you get, you'll deserve it
[Pre-Chorus]
Easy come, easy go
Thought the view from the top would be different
In this stone cold bed that you made
Now you sleep alone in it

That crumble in your hands (Oh, oh)

Taken advantage of people so young

Took a long vacation
No make-up, just JAY-Z
You were balls-deep, now we beefin'
Had me butt-naked at the MGM
So wasted, screamin', ""Fuck that""
Blurry now, but I meant it then
Hurry now, baby, stick it in
'Fore the memories get to kickin' in

You do
Nobody gets me, you do[Verse 2]
Took me out to the ballet
You proposеd, I went on the road
You was feelin' empty so you lеft me
Now I'm stuck dealin' with a deadbeat
If I'm real, I deserve less
If I was you, I wouldn't take me back
I pretend when I'm with a man it's you

And I know that it's too late, I don't wanna lose

imperfect for you Lyrics
[Verse 1]
My boy, come take my hand
Throw your guitar and your clothes in the back seat
My love, they don't understand
But I'll hold your hurt in the box here beside me

Now your name is crossed off
How you gonna fix this?
You can't even fix yourself

That I chose to spend here
All alone on New Year's
Thinkin', ""What the hell?""

I don't wanna break your thread and needle
Tryna stitch you, but I can't
I refuse

But we spent it all in nightclubs
All you ever wanna do is lie
Why you always such a Gemini?
Baby, who you tryna run from?
Me or all your problems?
You know you will never solve 'em
You don't even know yourself[Pre-Chorus]

[Intro: Common & 
Gil Scott-Heron
]
Yeah
I'm on my way home
[Verse: Common]
They say home is where the hate is,
 
my dome is where fate is
I stroll where souls get lost like Vegas
Seen through the eyes of rebel glasses
Pray to God that my arms reach the masses
The young smoke grass in grassless jungles
Rubber band together in cashless bundles
We wear strugglin' chains, divided only hustle remains
Makin' sense of it, we hustle for change
Revolution ain't a game, it's another name for life fightin'
Someone to stay in they corner like Mike Tyson
Hypes fightin' for hits to heighten they hell
Don't he know he could only get as high as he fell?
Show money becomes bail, relationships become jail
Children are unheld
I wish love was for sale
, 
""Behold the Pale - Horse""
Got me trapped like R. Kel'
, I bail and it—
[Outro: Gil Scott-Heron]
Might not be such a bad idea if I never, never went home again
I'm on my way home
I left three days ago, but no one seems to know I'm gone
Home is where the hatred is; home is filled with pain and it
Might not be such a bad idea if I never
Never went home again",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-my-way-home-lyrics,"“My Way Home” is the seventh track on Kanye’s second studio album, Late Registration. It samples “Home is Where the Hatred Is” by Gil Scott-Heron.

[Intro: Paul McCartney, John Lennon & George Harrison]
It's getting better all the time
[Verse 1: Paul McCartney, 
John Lennon & George Harrison
]
I used to get mad at my school (
Now, I can't complain
)
The teachers who taught me weren't cool (
Now, I can't complain
)
You're holding me down (Ah-ah), turning me 'round (
Ah-oh
)
Filling me up with your rules (
Fool, you fool
)
[Chorus: Paul McCartney, 
John Lennon & George Harrison
]
I've got to admit it's getting better (
Better
)
A little better all the time (
It can't get no worse

I have to admit it's getting better (
Better
)
It's getting better since you've been mine

Me used to be angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word, I finally heard
I'm doing the best that I can

I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved

And I'm doing the best that I can (
Fool, you fool

[Verse 1]
I got, I got, I got, I got—
Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA
I got power, poison, pain, and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle, though, ambition flow inside my DNA
I was born like this, since one like this, immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this, was Yeshua new weapon
I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed
This that I got, I got, I got, I got—
Realness, I just kill shit ’cause it's in my DNA
I got millions, I got riches buildin' in my DNA
I got dark, I got evil that rot inside my DNA
I got off, I got troublesome heart inside my DNA
I just win again, then win again, like Wimbledon, I serve
Yeah, that’s him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work, I know just who you are
See, you's a, you's a, you's a—
Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA
Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through prolly offend you, this is Paula's oldest son
I know murder, conviction, burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead Redemption, scholars, fathers dead with kids
And I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier’s DNA (
I’m a soldier's DNA
)
Born inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade
When I was nine, on sale motel, we didn’t have nowhere to stay
At twenty-nine, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I’m supposed to, antisocial extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And Nazareth gonna plead his case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar & 
Geraldo Rivera
]
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice, fuck your life
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a be-, fuck your life
Five, four, three, two, one
This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'
Money and power, the mecca of marriages
[Verse 2]
Tell me somethin'
You motherfuckers can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy, walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder, these are the breaks
These are the times, level number nine
Look up in the sky, ten is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder, our DNA[Video Outro]",https://genius.com/Kendrick-lamar-dna-lyrics,"",""

Oh, baby, I heard you been hoping you could change the past
You miss the long goodnights, you miss the long goodbyes

To walk it off like nothing happened, nonchalantly?

[Intro]
Please do not be alarmed, remain calm
Do not attempt to leave the dance-floor
The DJ booth is conducting a troubleshoot test of the entire system
[Verse 1]
I'm one of one, I'm number one, I'm the only one
Don't even waste your time trying to compete with me (Don't do it)
No one else in this world can think like me (True)
I'm twisted (Twisted), I'll contradict it
Keep him addicted, lies on his lips, I lick it
[Pre-Chorus]
Unique
That's what you are
Stilеttos kicking vintage crystal off the bar
Category: bad bitch, I'm thе bar
Alien superstar
Whip, whip
[Chorus]
I'm too classy for this world, forever, I'm that girl
Feed you diamonds and pearls, ooh, baby
I'm too classy to be touched, I paid them all in dust
I'm stingy with my love, ooh, baby[Post-Chorus]
I'm (U-N-I-Q-U-E)
Ooh, I'm stingy with my love, ooh, baby
I'm (U-N-I-Q-U-E)
Ooh, I'm stingy with my love (Unique)
[Verse 2]
Unicorn is the uniform you put on
Eyes on you when you perform
Eyes on I when I put on
Mastermind in haute couture
Label whores can't clock, I'm so obscure
 (Unique)
Masterpiece, genius
Drip intravenous
Patty cake on that wrist
Tiffany Blue billboards over that ceiling (Unique)
We don't like plain
Always dreamed of paper planes
Mile-high when I rodeo
Then I come down and take off again (Unique)
You see pleasure in my glare
Look over my shoulder and you ain't scared
The effects you have on me when you stare
Head on a pillow, hike it in the air
[Chorus]
I'm too classy for this world, forever, I'm that girl
Feed you diamonds and pearls, ooh, baby
I'm too classy to be touched, I paid them all in dust
I'm stingy with my love, ooh, baby[Post-Chorus]
I got pearls beneath my legs, my lips, my hands, my hips
 (U-N-I-Q-U-E)
I got diamonds beneath my thighs where his ego will find bliss
Can't find an ocean deep that can compete with this cinnamon kiss (U-N-I-Q-U-E)
Fire beneath your feet, music when you speak, you're so unique
[Bridge]
(Unique)
That's what you are
Lingerie reflecting off the mirror on the bar
Category: sexy bitch, I'm the bar
Alien superstar
[Outro: Beyoncé & 
Barbara Ann Teer
]
We dress a certain way
We walk a certain way
We talk a certain way
We, we paint a certain way
We, we make love a certain way, you know?
All of these things we do in a different
Unique, specific way that is personally ours
We just reaching out to the solar system
We flying over bullshit, we flying over
Supernatural love up in the air
I just talk my shit, Casanova
Superstar, supernova
Power, pull 'em in closer
If that's your man, then why he over here? (

Beyoncé’s *Alien Superstar*  is an unapologetic celebration of uniqueness, self-confidence, and being on a level above the rest.

Beyoncé positions herself—and by extension, her listeners—as untouchable, rare, and extraordinary, using cosmic and luxury metaphors (“I’m one of one, I’m number one, I’m the only one”).

Lyrically, *Alien Superstar* draws from ballroom culture, particularly with the repeated chant-like affirmations (“Category: bad bitch, I’m the bar”), reflecting the influence of Black queer and ballroom communities on *Renaissance*. The song embodies a high-fashion, high-art energy, making it an anthem for confidence, self-love, and embracing individuality. It’s about standing out, refusing to conform, and knowing your worth.

Bey is one of the best-selling artists of all time with over 350 million records sold worldwide (combined with 60 million records while she was part of the Destiny’s Child). She is one of the most-awarded female artists of all time. In 2021, she broke the record at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony for both the most awarded and the most nominated singer in Grammy’s history, with 28 Grammys won and total of 79 nominations. In 2012, she was third on VH1’s list of 100 Greatest Women In Music. Her visual album Lemonade won the prestigious award of Peabody in 2016 and was named the best female album of all time by several sources. In 2024 Apple Music put it on No.1 of the best music albums of all time. She was also recognized by many other societies for her contribution in music, humanitarian effort and philanthropy. After everything she achieved in her career, Beyoncé rightfully earned a nickname Queen B.

With the success she accumulated over the years, Beyoncé can easily say for herself that she’s one of the greatest of all time. She knows that what she accomplished is far greater from the average human, so she is defining her superstardom as being extraterrestrial, out of this world. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Beyonc%C3%A9/_/ALIEN+SUPERSTAR"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

[Verse 1]
How you ain't say you was movin' forward?
Honesty hurts when you're gettin' older
I gotta say, I'll miss the way you need me, yeah
Why you ain't say you was gettin' bored?
Why you ain't say I was fallin' short?
How you lead me out so far away?
[Pre-Chorus]
How could it be? Twenty-something
All alone, still not a thing in my name
Ain't got nothin', runnin' from love, only know fear
That's me, Ms. Twenty-Something
Ain't got nothin', runnin' from love
Wish you were here, oh
[Chorus]
Stuck in them twenty-somethings, stuck in them twenty-somethings
Good luck on them twenty-somethings, good luck on them twenty-somethings
But God bless these twenty-somethings
(God bless, oh, God bless, oh, God bless, oh, God bless, oh)
Hopin' my twenty-somethings won't end
Hopin' to keep the rest of my friends
Prayin' the twenty-somethings don't kill me, don't kill me
[Verse 2]
Weird
Took us so long to separate
I feel, it's permanent like a riptide, this time
Waves crashing fast, I try
Think of the past, please stay
(How could it be?)[Pre-Chorus]
How could it be? Twenty-something
All alone still, not a phone in my name (Name)
Ain't got nothin', runnin' from love, only know fear
That's me, Ms. Twenty-Something
Ain't got nothin', runnin' from love
Wish you were here, oh
[Chorus]
Stuck in them twenty-somethings, stuck in them twenty-somethings
Good luck on them twenty-somethings, good luck on them twenty-somethings
But God bless these twenty-somethings
(God bless, oh, God bless, oh, God bless, oh, God bless, oh)
Hopin' my twenty-somethings won't end
Hopin' to keep the rest of my friends
Prayin' the twenty-somethings don't kill me, don't kill me

[Outro: 
Mommy
 & SZA]
And if it's an illusion, I don't want to wake up. I'm gonna hang on to it. Because the, the, the alternative is an abyss, it's just a hole, a darkness, a nothingness. Who wants that? You know? So that's what I think about control. And that's my story, and I'm stickin' to it

beautiful

[Verse 1]
When I'm at the pearly gates
This'll be on my videotape, my videotape
When Mephistopheles is just beneath
And he's reaching up to grab me
This is one for the good days
And I have it all here
In red, blue, green
In red, blue, green
You are my centre when I spin away
Out of control on videotape
On videotape, on videotape, on videotape
On videotape, on videotape, on videotape
[Verse 2]
This is my way of saying goodbye
Because I can't do it face to face
So I'm talking to you before-
No matter what happens now
You shouldn't be afraid
Because I know today has been
The most perfect day
I've ever seen",https://genius.com/Radiohead-videotape-lyrics,"Videotape is the final track from Radiohead's 2007 album In Rainbows. According to the Videotape Songfacts, the song is about a dying man saying goodbye to loved ones on old-fashioned videotape. 

Thom Yorke described the process of composing Videotape as ""absolute agony"", stating that the song ""went through every possible parameter"". One day, Yorke left the studio, returning to find that Godrich and Jonny Greenwood had stripped the song down to the version found on the album, a minimal piano ballad.

[Verse 1]
I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone, and Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light, go
Hey, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day
[Chorus]
And darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground
[Verse 2]
Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We blocked the noise with the sound of, ""I need you""
And for the first time, I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But sometimes, I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd[Chorus]
'Cause darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground
[Bridge]
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
[Chorus]
It was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground
[Outro]
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance

In the song, Taylor is looking back at a whirl wind relationship from her past. She’s realizing just because the relationship didn’t last, doesn’t mean it wasn’t a good memory or that it was wasted time. The memories are still important and sacred. Just because Taylor and the guy weren’t meant to be, doesn’t mean she can’t look back fondly at the time they spent together. Every mistake is a lesson learned.

The song’s hidden message is “When you came to the show in SD” which leads to assumption that this song was penned about Joe Jonas who was spotted at Taylor’s San Diego show during the Speak Now tour <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Swift/_/Holy+Ground"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

[Verse 1]
Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels
But I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song
But I do, I do
[Verse 2]
I walked in, expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is
But I do
[Chorus]
And you throw your head back laughin' like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinkin' all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday, in a café, I watched it begin again
[Verse 3]
You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you
But I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm comin' off a little shy
But I do[Chorus]

Thinkin' all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday, in a café, I watched it begin again
[Bridge]
And we walked down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies
That your family watches every single Christmas
And I wanna talk about that
And for the first time, what's past is past

'Cause you throw your head back laughin' like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did

Only Angel Lyrics
“Only Angel” is the sixth track on Harry Styles' self-titled solo debut album.

After a soft, ethereal opening (including an excerpt from ‘'Barfly’‘), “Only Angel” swells and bursts into a rollicking romp…

[Intro]
I saw this angel
 (Ooh)
I really saw an angel
 (Ooh, ooh)
Hey, hey
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
[Verse 1]
Open up your eyes, shut your mouth and see
That I'm still the only one who's been in love with me
I'm just happy getting you stuck in between my teeth
And there's nothing I can do about it
Broke a finger knocking on your bedroom door
I got splinters in my knuckles crawling 'cross the floor
Couldn't take you home 
to mother in a skirt that short
But I think that's what I like about it
[Chorus]
She's an angel (Ooh), only angel (Ooh)
She's an angel (Ooh), my only angel (Ooh)
[Verse 2]
I must admit I thought I'd like to make you mine
As I went about my business through the warning signs
End up meetin' in the hallway every single time
And there's nothin' we can do about it
Told it to her brother and she told it to me
That she's gonna be an angel, just you wait and see
When it turns out she's a devil in between the sheets
And there's nothing she can do about it, hey, hey[Chorus]
She's an angel (Ooh), only angel (Ooh)
She's an angel (Ooh), my only angel (Ooh)
She's an angel (Ooh), only angel (Ooh)
She's an angel (Ooh), my only angel (Ooh)
[Post-Chorus]
(Oh, ow, ow, hey)
(Wanna die, wanna die)

The track continues the 70s rock-influenced sound heard throughout Harry’s self-titled debut, and the repeated “Ooh-ooh-hoo” hook is very likely a reference to the similar one at the end of each verse in Electric Light Orchestra’s classic tune, “Don’t Bring Me Down”.

“Only Angel” was recorded in one take at Harry’s London home, and the 23-year-old singer has described the song as “perky”.

[Verse 1]
I know a girl, she's like a curse
We want each other, no one will break first
So many nights trying to find someone new
They don't mean nothing compared to her, and I know
[Pre-Chorus]
When people ask about us, now, we just brush it off
I don't know why we act like it means nothing at all
I wish that I could tell you that you're all that I want, yeah
[Chorus]
I pretend that I'm not ready
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?
And you say ""hi"" like you just met me
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?
[Verse 2]
When I hear you sing, it gets hard to breathe
Can't help but think every song's about me
And every line, every word that I write
You are the muse in the back of my mind, oh[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna ask about it 'cause you might brush it off
I'm afraid you think that it means nothing at all
I don't know why I won't admit that you're all I want
[Chorus]
I pretend that I'm not ready
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?
And you say ""hi"" like you just met me
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?

Written over soft keys with a guitar in the back ground, the song follows a smooth pattern, reminiscent of R&B music. Shawn uses a vocoder towards the end of the song, which splits his voice into vocal chords to convey a beautiful but yet sad and vulnerable sound, which fits into the context of the song.

The song is widely speculated to be about Camila Cabello with whom Shawn Mendes has had a burgeoning friendship with since 2015. The two have collaborated on music in the past, with Camila featured on “I Know What You Did Last Summer”. Rumours of the two dating are almost as old as their friendship itself. They both met opening for Austin Mahone at his concert in 2014 and became friends during Taylor Swift’s 1989 Tour in 2015. Both of them have repeatedly denied they were involved. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Shawn+Mendes/_/Why"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Whistlin' my name
Open up a beer and you say, ""Get over here

This Love Lyrics
“This Love” is a slow burning ballad which finds Camila entangled in toxic relationship, trying to get  the love “out of [her] veins” as she falls for her lover’s games “again and again”.
[Intro]
No, no, no
[Verse 1]
Know just how to make me miss ya
When I'm feelin' sentimental
Goin' in our separate ways
But wind up back here in the middle
Losin' you I couldn't face
But to love you is worse
Waitin' for you just in case
One day it doesn't hurt, nah, nah, nah
[Pre-Chorus]
Said it's the last time, but nah, nah, nah, nah
Just like the last time, yeah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Tired of building up my walls, yeah
Just to watch them fall again
[Chorus]
So fuck this love callin' my name
Get out of my veins
If you need your space, then just walk away
You know how to fuck me up, then make it okay
I guess that's just your game
And I'm the one who gets played
Again, and again, and again, and again[Verse 2]
Maybe you should set me free
Maybe I don't really want you to
Maybe I just wanna be
Be the person that you just can't lose
If you're gonna leave, then go
If you need me, let me know
Love me or just let me go
But no, nah, nah, nah
[Pre-Chorus]
Said it's the last time, but nah, nah, nah, nah
Just like the last time, yeah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Tired of building up my walls, yeah
Just to watch them fall again

Fuck this love callin' my name
Get out of my veins
If you need your space, then just walk away
You know how to fuck me up, then make it okay
I guess that's just your game
And I'm the one who gets played
Again, and again, and again, and again
[Bridge]
Maybe you should set me free
Maybe I don't really want you to
Maybe I just wanna be
Be the person that you just can't lose
No, there I go and fall again[Chorus]
Fuck this love (Yeah yeah) callin' my name
Get out of my veins (Get out of my veins)
If you need your space, then just walk away
You know how to fuck me up, then make it okay
I guess that's just your game (That's just your game)
And I'm the one who gets played

Sunrise with you on my chest
No blinds in the place where I live
Daybreak, open your eyes
'Cause this was only ever meant to be for one night
Still, we're changin' our minds here
Be yours, be my dear
So close with you on my lips
Touch noses, feelin' your breath
Push your heart and pull away, yeah
Be my summer in a winter day, love
I can't see one thing wrong
Between the both of us
Be mine, be mine, yeah
Anytime, anytime

Ooh, you know I've been alone for quite a while, haven't I?
I thought I knew it all
Found love but I was wrong
More times than enough
But since you came along
I'm thinkin', baby

You (Yeah) are bringin' out a different kind of me
There's no safety net that's underneath
I'm free
Fallin' all in you
Fell for men who weren't how they appear (Yeah)
Trapped up on a tightrope, now we're here
We're free
Fallin' all in you[Verse 2]
Fast forward a couple years, yeah
Grown up in the place that we live
Make love, then we fight
Laugh 'cause it was only meant to be for one night, baby
I guess we can't control
What's just not up to us
Be mine, be mine, yeah
Anytime, anytime

[Verse 1]
Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)

My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)

I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)
[Verse 2]
Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no ""Mrs.""
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, ""Which one?"" I say, ""Nah, I want all of 'em""
Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms[Pre-Chorus]
My smile is beamin' (Yeah), my skin is gleamin' (Is gleamin')
The way it shine, I know you've seen it (You've seen it)
I bought a crib just for (Just for) the closet (Closet)
Both his and hers, I want it, I got it, yeah

I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Baby)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it (Oh yeah)
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)
[Verse 3]
Yeah, my receipts be lookin' like phone numbers
If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me
I don't mean to brag, but I be like, ""Put it in the bag,"" yeah
When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, gimme the loot
Never mind, I got the juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it, then that's what I get, yeah[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah)

[Verse 1]
I know I have good judgment, 
I know I have good taste
It's funny and it's ironic that only I feel that way
I promise 'em that you're different and everyone makes mistakes
But just don't
I heard that you're an actor, so act like a stand-up guy
Whatever devil's inside you, don't let him out tonight
I tell them it's just your culture and everyone rolls their eyes
Yeah, I know
All I'm asking, baby
[Chorus]
Please, please, please
Don't prove I'm right
And please, pleasе, please
Don't bring me to tеars when I just did my makeup so nice
Heartbreak is one thing, my ego's another
I beg you, don't embarrass me, motherfucker, oh
Please, please, please (Ah)
[Verse 2]
Well, I have a fun idea, babe (Uh-huh), maybe just stay inside
I know you're cravin' some fresh air, but the ceiling fan is so nice (It's so nice, right?)
And we could live so happily if no one knows that you're with me
I'm just kidding, but really (Kinda), really, really[Chorus]
Please, please, please (Please don't prove I'm right)
Don't prove I'm right
And please, please, please
Don't bring me to tears when I just did my makeup so nice
Heartbreak is one thing (Heartbreak is one thing), my ego's another (Ego's another)
I beg you, don't embarrass me, motherfucker, oh
Please, please, please (Ah)
[Outro]
If you wanna go and be stupid
Don't do it in front of me
If you don't wanna cry to my music
Don't make me hate you prolifically
Please, please, please (Please)
Please, please, please (Please)
Please (Please), please (Please), please

It was released on June 6, 2024, through Island Records, as the second single from her sixth studio album, Short n' Sweet. Produced by Jack Antonoff, the pop ballad contains musical influences of disco, country, and yacht rock; lyrically, the singer instructs her boyfriend not to blunder and blemish her reputation.

An instant commercial success, the song debuted at number one in Ireland, becoming Carpenter's second consecutive chart-topping single in that country, and has also reached the top ten in Australia, Norway, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.

Following the commercial success of ""Espresso"", the singer announced her upcoming sixth studio album Short n' Sweet on June 3, 2024. She simultaneously promised an upcoming surprise for her fans, which would turn out to be the single. Only two days later, Carpenter took to social media to announce the song's release and share a teaser of the accompanying music video featuring cinematic visuals set to showcase her acting skills. The clip shows her wearing a lacy red outfit in a robbery-like setting, as well as engaging in a romance with a criminal played by her real-life boyfriend Barry Keoghan.

The music video for ""Please Please Please"" serves as a sequel to the ""Espresso"" music video released earlier in 2024. In the music video for ""Espresso"", Carpenter gets arrested at the end. “I ended the last video getting arrested, so naturally I thought it would be satisfying to start the ‘Please Please Please’ video in jail,” said the singer. “I liked the idea of falling in love with a convict and being shocked and embarrassed every time he commits crimes. I was sooo lucky to get Barry Keoghan in the video ’cause he is just magic on screen.” said the singer after the music video was released. The Irish actor is rumored to be Carpenter's off-screen boyfriend after they started being seen together in December 2023 and throughout 2024.

Bardia Zeinali, the music video director, commented about the inspiration for the music video to GQ. ""The concept was pretty collaborative. I had a brief from Sabrina's team – they wanted it to pick up from where “Espresso” left off and they wanted it to be about this person that Sabrina's character keeps falling for, that has this chaotic behaviour. So I just elaborated on that and started to think a bit more about specifically what happens. I liked this idea of there being a role reversal and an exchange of power towards the end. And things that were recurring, like her picking him up in the same place, same location, different day, different time."", said the director to GQ. ""Pam and Tommy. Madonna and Dennis Rodman. Tarantino was a big reference point. Natural Born Killers. Bonnie and Clyde, obviously. Even Thelma & Louise. We were really looking at film references more than anything else and pop culture references in terms of what we wanted the spirit of this moment to be. Even J Lo and Ben Affleck – not to reference, but to capture that spirit. It's similar in the sense that they're this really exciting young couple, both having big moments in their respective careers, coming together and making a piece of art. But this is very much not real life – it's a story,"" said the director. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Sabrina+Carpenter/_/Please+Please+Please"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

[Verse 1: SZA]
Good day in my mind, safe to take a step out
Get some air now, let yo' edge out
Too soon, I spoke
You be heavy in my mind, can you get the heck out?
I need rest now, got me bummed out
You so, you so, you
Baby, baby, babe
I've been on my empty mind shit
[Pre-Chorus: SZA]
I try to keep from losin' the rest of me
I worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe
You don't care
Said, ""Not tryna be a nuisance, this is urgent""
Tryna make sense of loose change
Got me a war in my mind
Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holdin' me
Choose to watch while the world break up in front of me

Tell me I'm not my fears, my limitations
I disappear if you let me
Feelin' like, yeah (
On your own
)
Feelin' like Jericho
Feelin' like Job when he lost his shit
Gotta hold my own,
 
my cross to bear alone, I
Ooh, played and dipped, way to kill the mood
Know you like that shit
Can't groove it, ba-baby
Heavy on my empty mind shit

Good day living in my mind[Verse 3: SZA]
Gotta get right
Tryna free my mind before the end of the world
I don't miss no ex, I don't miss no text
I choose not to respond
I don't regret, just pretend shit never happened
Half of us layin' waste to our youth, it's in the present
(Na-na, na-na, na-na, na)
Half of us chasin' fountains of youth and it's in the present now

Oh, hey
[Verse 1]
Yeah
Well, you look so happy walking down the street
Don't you, babe? (Don't you, babe? Huh?)
Did you forget
You said that, in this lifetime, you could never get over me?
Are you over me? (Uh)
[Pre-Chorus]
When I said I hope you're happy, didn't mean it
Never thought you'd be so good at moving on (On)
When I'm lying wide awake, you're probably sleeping (Ha)
And maybe what I'm thinking is wrong
[Chorus]
I want you to cry for me, cry for me
Say you'd d-d-die for me, die for me
And if you can't, then baby, lie for me, lie for me (Huh)
'Cause you haunt me when I'm dreamin'
And it's time you know the feeling
So cry for me
[Verse 2]
See that pretty life in pictures (Ha)
See her lips erasing me (Mm)
You're so good to her, it's vicious
Yeah, she should be thanking me
Who, who's gonna touch you like me?
Yeah, tell me who
Who can make you forget about me? (Oh)[Pre-Chorus]
When I said I hope you're happy, didn't mean it (Didn't mean it, yeah)
Never thought you'd be so good at moving on (On, on)

And it's time you know the feeling
So, baby, won't you cry for me, cry for me? (Cry for me)
Say you'd d-d-die for me, die for me (Oh, won't you cry?)
And if you can't, then baby, lie for me, lie for me (Ooh)

And it's time you know the feeling
So cry for me

Why won't you cry?
Tears in my eyes, yeah
And you're okay, you're okay
How can you be okay?
No, why won't you cry?[Chorus]
I want you to cry for me, cry for me (Oh, yeah)
Say you'd d-d-die for me, die for me
And if you can't, then baby, lie for me, lie for me

Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, turn it up, my headphones
To the maker, vibrator
Roof shaker, earthquaker
Annihilator
Yeah
[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Baby, please get off the 'Gram
I like you better in the stands
I upgrade my only fan
It do or don't need a cam'
This right here my new modern jam
I'm on fire, the new burnin' man
She paid to view, that's an on-demand
Hey, Guy-Man, brought him home from France
This shit punk
, put it on the Bible
I like a bi girl on a bi-cycle
Then I bought a car, now she feel entitled
My dick so hard, pokin' likе the Eiffel
I just need the world, I ain't hard to plеase
Way I keep the knowledge, think I'm Socrates
I got 'em levitatin' way off their knees
The way I make it jump, I make it hard to breathe, it's like
[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Bright, tight
The annihilator, forever favor
True upgrader, you a shaker
Car breaker[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Baby, don't you know I got to go?
Got the glow and it got to show
Know it's been a year since I seen the road
Had me inside like I'm on parole
I'm outside like I'm on patrol
I hear the zeitgeist, now I'm in the zone
You know they say you up when you finally free
It won't feel right if it's only me
If you're scared, nigga, say your grace
I got the formula like I own the race
I got the keys with me like I own the place
If these niggas on top, then I'm outta space
I'd rather spend it on you than on Uncle Sam
Give this shit my all but don't give a damn
Even in the winter, it's a summer jam
I told her buckle up 'cause it's goin' down, it's like
[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Bright
Truth breaker, heartthrob, baby
Feather skater, you true raider
Daka-doo-doo-da-da
[Verse 3: Teezo Touchdown]
Uh-uh, I know you're lyin'
Outside waitin' in the line
Gettin' dough one at a time (Oh)
Uh-uh, I know you're lyin'
Outside waitin' in the line
Gettin' dough one at a time (Oh)
Bounce, baby, I'm in the buildin', baby
Do it, baby, you got my consent, baby
Oh, this the remix, oh, this the remix
Before she let me in, she gotta pat me down
Before she let me in, she gotta pat me down[Outro: Travis Scott]

(Ah, ah)
[Verse 1]
Did the world stop spinnin'? Nothin' seems to change
I'm stuck at the beginnin' and I'm in pain
Did the sun stop risin'? 'Cause the sky's so gray
Did the world stop spinnin' today?

I woke up, fell back to sleep
'Cause I'd rather live in my dreams
I lay here wondering why

Did the world stop spinnin'? Am I frozen in time?
'Cause the birds stopped singin', are we flawed by design?
My heartbeat's racin' like a strange ballet
Did the world stop spinnin' today?

I woke up, fell back to sleep (Sleep)
'Cause I'd rather live in my dreams (Ah)
I lay here wondering why

The lights are all dimming and, ah
The world has stopped spinning
The end is beginning and, ah

Oh, the world stopped spinnin', nothin' seems to change
I'm stuck at the beginnin' and I'm still in pain

And boots weren't made for sitting by the door
Since you don't wanna stay anymore
[Chorus]
You can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on, ride away in your Silverado
Guess I'll see you 'round again
I know my place, and it ain't with you
Well sunsets fade, and love does, too
Yeah, we had our day in the sun
When a horse wants to run, there ain't no sense in closing the gate
You can have your space, cowboy
[Verse 2]
After the gold rush, there ain't no reason to stay
Shoulda learned from the movies that good guys don't run away
But roads weren't made to not go down
And there ain't room for both of us in this town
[Chorus]
So you can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on, ride away in your Silverado
I'll see you around again
'Cause I know my place, and it ain't with you
Sunsets fade, and love does, too
We had our day in the sun
When a horse wants to run, ain't no sense in closing the gate
So you can have your space[Chorus]
You can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on, ride away in your Silverado
I'll see you around again
'Cause I know my place, and it ain't with you
Sunsets fade, and love does, too
Though we had our day in the sun
When a horse wants to run, ain't no sense in closing the gate
You can have your space
Yeah, you can have your space
You can have your space, cowboy",https://genius.com/Kacey-musgraves-space-cowboy-lyrics,"",""

Climbing Up the Walls Lyrics
Sung from the perspective of paranoid fear itself, “Climbing Up the Walls” takes the English idiomatic expression for utter unpleasant feelings, such as worry and doubt giving the expression a voice.

[Verse 1]
I am the key to the lock in your house
That keeps your toys in the basement
But if you get too far inside
You'll only see my reflection
[Verse 2]
It's always best with the covers up
I am the pick in the ice
Do not cry out or hit the alarm
You know we're friends till we die
[Chorus]
And either way you turn, I'll be there
Open up your skull, I'll be there
Climbing up the walls
[Verse 3]
It's always best when the light is off
It's always better on the outside
Fifteen blows to the back of your head
Fifteen blows to your mind
[Verse 4]
So lock the kids up safe tonight
Shut the eyes in the cupboard
I've got the smell of a local man
Who's got the loneliest feeling[Chorus]
And either way he turns, I'll be there
Open up your skull, I'll be there
Climbing up the walls
[Instrumental Break]

“Climbing Up the Walls” Is one of the first tracks by the band to be described as “scary.” Relying heavily on strings, but not in a conventional way, as the string section, composed by Jonny Greenwood alone, features 16 different violins playing quarter tones apart from one another.

Thom accompanies the chilling melodies with equally haunting lyrics about the relentless internal demons people face.

“Climbing Up the Walls” is the sixteenth track in the 01 10 playlist and serves to complement “Reckoner” from Radiohead’s In Rainbows album.


Thom: ""This is about the unspeakable. Literally skull-crushing. I used to work in a mental hospital around the time that Care In The Community started, and we all just knew what was going to happen. And it's one of the scariest things to happen in this country, because a lot of them weren't just harmless... It was hailing violently when we recorded this. It seemed to add to the mood. Some people can't sleep with the curtains open in case they see the eyes they imagine in their heads every night burning through the glass. Lots of people have panic buttons fitted in their bedrooms so they can reach over and set the alarm off without disturbing the intruder. This song is about the cupboard monster."" 

From a Radiohead interview published in Rolling Stone in 2017 for the 20th anniversary of OK Computer:

Phil Selway: Because of the ghosts, I probably went to bed with the duvet pulled up to my nose every night. So the album did have that slightly wired feeling to it, which I think you can hear in “Climbing Up the Walls.”

Thom Yorke: That one’s a bit of a mystery to me, to be honest. I used to work in a home for the severely mentally ill for a while in this little village. And I remember one of them escaping one night – he was perfectly harmless, but he was really ill. I mean he couldn’t be out in society anyway. But because it was in a little village it sort of stuck with me. This idea of this guy in the middle of a field and the police chasing him.

Then I had read some newspaper piece about about a normal domestic murder where obviously the person concerned was not well. I was fascinated in a kind of twisted way about what is it that makes someone who can go through life and just snap one day and do something that you can’t possibly imagine. And it was in the context that people don’t get looked after like they should. Depression for example at the time was something that everybody just went, “Oh, well, you’re just depressed.” But now it can lead into other things like if someone gets ill, they can be a danger to themselves and to other people. That’s what I think about when I play it now. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/_/Climbing+Up+the+Walls"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

[Intro]
One, two, three, four
[Verse 1]
Wakey wakey, rise and shine
It's on again, off again, on again
Watch me fall like dominoes
In pretty patterns
Fingers in the blackbird pie
I'm tingling, tingling, tingling
It's what you feel not what you ought to
What you ought to
Reasonable and sensible
[Chorus]
Dead from the neck up
I guess I'm stuffed, stuffed, stuffed
We thought you had it in you
But not, not, not
For no real reason
[Verse 2]
Squeeze the tubes and empty bottles
I take a bow, take a bow, take a bow
It's what you feel not what you ought to
What you ought to
The elephant that's in the room
Is tumbling, tumbling, tumbling
In duplicate and triplicate and
Plastic bags
In duplicate and triplicate[Chorus]
Dead from the neck up
I guess I'm stuffed, stuffed, stuffed
We thought you had it in you
But not, not, not
Exactly where do you get off
Is enough, is enough?
I love you but enough is enough
Enough of that stuff
There's no real reason

[Verse 1]
Not sure what I was doing before ya

Someone beside you when it's time to lay down
Fully committed, you're here for the stay down
Look in the mirror, you right for the takedown

Room for you in my coupe, let me open up the door
Open up my eyes to a feelin' I can't ignore

Never thought I could ever be loyal
To someone other than myself

Guess anything is possible with your help
Anything's possible since you made my heart melt

Room for you in my coupe, let me open up the door
Open up my eyes to a feelin' I can't ignore

Poor Lil Rich Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I let my watch talk for me, my whip talk for me
My gat talk for me, blaow, what up, homie?
My watch saying, ""Hi, shorty, we could be friends"" (Woo)
My whip saying, ""Quit playin', bitch, get in"" (Bitch)
My earring saying, ""We can hit the mall together""
Shorty, it's only right that we ball together
I'm into bigger things, y'all niggas, y'all know my style
Your wrist bling-bling, my shit bling-blaow
My pinky ring talk, it say, ""50, I'm sick""
That's why these niggas is on my dick
Some hate me, some love my hits
Flex my man, he gon' bump my shit
See, I'm a liar, man, I really don't care (I don't care)
I tell the hoes whatever they wan' hear
You tryna play me, I'ma blaze you then
My cross cost more than the crib your mama raised you in
[Chorus]
I was a poor nigga, now I'm a rich nigga
Getting paper, now you can't tell me shit, nigga
You can find me in the four-dot-six, nigga
In the backseat fondling your bitch, nigga
Was a poor nigga, now I'm a rich nigga
Getting paper, now you can't tell me shit, nigga
You can find me in the four-dot-six, nigga
In the backseat fondling your bitch, nigga[Verse 2]
New York niggas copy niggas like it's all good
Fuck around, be Crip-walking in the wrong hood
I'm fresh up out the slammer, I ain't no fuckin' bammer
I'm from NY, woadie, but I know country grammar (Woo)
See, me, I get it crunk, niggas go 'head and front
I go and pop the trunk, come back, pull out and dump (Yeah)
My money come in lumps, my pockets got the mumps
You see me sittin' on dubs, that's why you mad, chump (Uh-huh)
Don't make me hit you up, these shells'll split you up
I lay you down, the coroners'll come and get you up
See, 50 play for keeps and 50 stay with heat
I can't go commercial, they love me in the street
I'm real gutter, man, the hood love me, man
Don't make me show up in your crib like Bruh-Man
Locked up in the pen', I still do my thing
CO screaming, ""Shut the fuck up"" in the bing
[Chorus]
I was a poor nigga, now I'm a rich nigga
Getting paper, now you can't tell me shit, nigga
You can find me in the four-dot-six, nigga

Was a poor nigga, now I'm a rich nigga
Getting paper, now you can't tell me shit, nigga
You can find me in the four-dot-six, nigga

I'm in the Benz on Monday, a BM on Tuesday
Range on Wednesday, Thursday, I'm in the hooptay
Porsche on Friday, I do things my way
Vipe' or 'Vette, I tear up the highway (Woo)

Think I lied a little, I
I said if we took it there, I wasn't gonna change
But that went out the window, yeah (
Gonna break, gonna break
)
[Pre-Chorus]
I know that I seem a little stressed out
But you're here now, and you're turning me on
I wanna feel a different kinda tension
Yeah, you guessed it, the kind that's fun
Hate it when you leave me unattended
'Cause I miss ya, and I need your love
When my mind is runnin' wild
Could you help me slow it down?

Put my mind at ease
Pretty please
I need your hands on me
Sweet relief
Pretty please

Exactly where I want me, yeah
Underneath your body, yeah
If we take it further, I swear I ain't gonna break
So, baby, come try me
Baby, come find me
Baby, don't wind me up[Pre-Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Niggas screw they face up at me
On some real shit, son they don’t want beef
I cock that, aim that shit out the window and spray
There ain’t a shell left in my heat
Y’all niggas better lay down, yeah, I mean stay down
You get hit with AK round, your ass ain’t gon’ make it
You niggas will get laid out, your blood and your brains out
Have you on the concrete shivering and shaking
I’m from Southside
 motherfucker, 
where them gats explode
If you feel like you’re on fire, boy drop and roll
Niggas will eat your ass up, cause they heart turned cold
Now you can be a victim or you can lock and load
The party jump, shorty bouncin that ass, I wanna fuck
Gimme a second I’mma holla, I’mma see whassup
I got my razor in my hand, got my pistol in the trunk
Carve your ass up nice you play me like a punk
[Chorus]
In my hood
 
niggas got love for me
But I don’t go nowhere without my strap
In my hood
 
a little ’dro
, a little Hennessy
And niggas just don’t know how to act
In my hood
 niggas is grimey
I stay on point, I roll with my gat
In my hood
 
niggas might buck at me
So I keep something around to buck back
In my hood[Verse 2]
I don’t trust a muh’fuckin soul
When the D’s come they fold, on my first case they told
Where I’m from it ain’t safe to have more than a eighth
Niggas’ll come to your place, put a gun in your face
Tell you open the safe, as your heart start to race
Cause a robbery could turn into a homo’ case
Co-operate, or Doc’ll have to operate
Niggas I’ll pop you, run a light then pop at Jake
Trust me son, niggas’ll go hard for that cake
These thirsty niggas are lurking, you’ll have to catch ’em and merk ’em
I’m observant in my hood, cause niggas be dumbing
Shots forfeit the dice game, all you see is the running
They make it harder and harder to pump on the block
I’m a hustler, how the fuck I’m ’sposed to eat when it’s hot?
[Chorus]
In my hood
 niggas got love for me
But I don’t go nowhere without my strap
In my hood
 
a little ’dro
, a little Hennessy
And niggas just don’t know how to act
In my hood
 niggas is grimey
I stay on point, I roll with my gat
In my hood
 niggas might buck at me
So I keep something around to buck back
In my hood[Verse 3]
The house party 
(Go)
 off the hook 
(Go)
 until them shots 
(Go)
 go off 
(Go)
Well that’s what you get for stuntin on my block showoff
Ah, you shit out of luck if niggas catch you slippin' (Uh-huh)
Crack money slow so you know niggas is trippin' (Yea!)
Shorty down there on that Queens tracks takin a whippin'
Sheeit, bitch get out of pocket, she need some discipline
Peep the fiend shootin diesel in his arm in the alley (Ahhhhh)
Look at the chrome spinner spinnin on that black Denali (Wooo)
The grimey niggas where I’m from don’t wanna see you chipped up
You shine, they gon' jux you or probably shoot your whip up
It ain’t good to do good in my hood
**Gun cocking and firing sound effect**
You know not to do good now

But I don’t go nowhere without my strap

Ryder Music Lyrics
Track 12 off of 50’s second studio album, The Massacre
[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah we can ride to this
Just lay back and cruise
[Verse 1]
Here's a taste of my life, it's bitter and sweet
I pour my heart out to the sounds of the drums and the beat
I put my life on the line when I'm out on the street
Put my Teflon on, and roll with my heat
I keep my circle nice and small, I don't fuck with these clown niggas
In the race for the cheese, I run laps around niggas
Soon as I step on stage, the crowd applauds
Soon as my sneaker went in stores, Reebok stock soared
I ain't gotta say I'm a boss, niggas can tell
The East Coast crib the size of a small hotel
The shit journalists write about me leave me confused
Have me feeling like the heavyweight champ when he lose
I read somewhere I'm homophobic, shit
Go through the hood, there's mad niggas on my dick
Now, we can get hostile, or we can do this smooth
TNT around, I can still make blow move
[Chorus]
This is what you call rider music
All the gangsters are riding to it—c'mon, let's roll
I can show you how we do it
When we ride to that rider music, (Let's go) let's go
This is what you call rider music
All the gangsters are riding to it—c'mon, let's roll
I can show you how we do it
When we ride to that rider music, (Let's go) let's go[Verse 2]
Last year, I woke up with good luck; damn, it feels good
On the low, I done fucked like half of Hollywood
Had your favorite actress from your favorite shows
In my favorite position—you know how it goes
And my Bentley bumpin' Prince shit, this is 
When Doves Cry
This is what it sounds like when hollow-tip slugs fly
Homie, this is something you can ride and smoke to
Stay on point, 'cause niggas will ride and smoke you
Jealousy's for women, but some niggas is bitch-made
They make you wanna run across they head with a switchblade
They point the finger at me, saying I'm bugged
My flow's crack, you listen, your fucking brain's on drugs
Look, ice drippin' on my neck, hands gripping on a TEC
Fool tripping, threw a set, you can get your ass wet
Cards messing up my deck, screws loose show respect
You try to come at me kid, your ass better come correct
[Chorus]
This is what you call rider music
All the gangsters are riding to it—c'mon, let's roll
I can show you how we do it
When we ride to that rider music, (Let's go) let's go
This is what you call rider music
All the gangsters are riding to it—c'mon, let's roll
I can show you how we do it
When we ride to that rider music, (Let's go) let's go[Verse 3]
My mama gave birth to a winner, I gotta win
Pray the Lord forgive me for my sins (Uh-huh), I'm still thugging
Cruising, rims gleaming like the stones on my wrist
Zoning—guess this is how it feels to be rich, 
homie
You hustlin' backwards if you chasin' a bitch, stupid
Chase the paper they come with the shit
I'm falling... in love with success
Entrepreneur, connoisseur, I maneuver the best
Rolling Ruger on my lap, rubber grip on the handle
Stunner, have your homies burning Rest-in-Peace candles
As wise men speak, I listen and learn
A man dies, a baby's born,
 
my nigga, the world turns
Rappers, I make 'em sick when I say I'm the shit
They mistake my confidence for arrogance, they hate on the kid
In '99, I had a vision and made a decision
Being broke is against my religion, now I'm caked up, what!
[Chorus]
This is what you call rider music
All the gangsters are riding to it—c'mon, let's roll
I can show you how we do it
When we ride to that rider music, (Let's go) let's go
This is what you call rider music
All the gangsters are riding to it—c'mon, let's roll
I can show you how we do it
When we ride to that rider music, (Let's go) let's go
This is what you call rider music
All the gangsters are riding to it—c'mon, let's roll
I can show you how we do it
When we ride to that rider music, (Let's go) let's go
This is what you call rider music

[Verse 1]
Taste the poison from your lips
Lately, we're as good as gone
Oh, our love is drunken in
Singing me my favorite song
[Pre-Chorus]
Me and you
We were made to break
I know the truth
But it's much too late
[Chorus]
You're perfectly wrong for me
And that's why it's so hard to leave
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me
You're perfectly wrong for me
All the stars in the sky could see
Why you're perfectly wrong for me
[Verse 2]
Oh, you know how much it hurts
Every time you say you hate me
But when we're making love, you make it worth it
I can't believe the places that you take me[Pre-Chorus]
There's no use
We were made to break
I know the truth
And it's much too late

Why you're perfectly wrong for me

Oh, and why can't I quit
When you break my heart open
I need you more than I know
Oh, and I can't resist
When you're up against my skin
I never wanna let you go

You're perfectly wrong for me
And that's why it's so hard for me
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me, mm
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me
Hate that you know that I won't leave

[Verse 1]
Youngblood thinks there's always tomorrow
I miss your touch some nights when I'm hollow
I know you crossed a bridge that I can't follow
Since the love that you left is all that I get, I want you to know
[Chorus]
That if I can't be close to you
I'll settle for the ghost of you
I miss you more than life (More than life)
And if you can't be next to me
Your memory is ecstasy
I miss you more than life
I miss you more than life
[Verse 2]
Youngblood thinks there's always tomorrow
I need more time, but time can't be borrowed
I'd leave it all behind if I could follow
Since the love that you left is all that I get, I want you to know
[Chorus]
That if I can't be close to you
I'll settle for the ghost of you
I miss you more than life (Yeah)
And if you can't be next to me
Your memory is ecstasy (Oh)
I miss you more than life
I miss you more than life[Bridge]
Woah
Na-na-na
More than life (Oh)
[Chorus]
So if I can't get close to you
I'll settle for the ghost of you

Oh, oh (
Ooh
)
Woah, oh
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah (
Ow
)
Uh
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propellin'
Let these words be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And with that being said, my nigga, let me ask this question:
[Refrain: Kendrick Lamar]
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan—
(One two, one two, one two)
Uh, when shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propellin'
Let these words be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And with that being said, my nigga, let me ask this question:[Refrain: Kendrick Lamar]
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Won't you look to your left and right? Make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Do you believe in me? Are you deceiving me?
Could I let you down easily? Is your heart where it need to be?
Is your smile on permanent? Is your vow on lifetime?
Would you know where the sermon is if I died in this next line?
If I'm tried in a court of law, if the industry cut me off
If the government want me dead, plant cocaine in my car
Would you judge me a drug-head or see me as K. Lamar?
Or question my character and degrade me on every blog?
Want you to love me like Nelson, want you to hug me like Nelson
I freed you from being a slave in your mind, you're very welcome
You tell me my song is more than a song, it's surely a blessing
But a prophet ain't a prophet 'til they ask you this question:
[Refrain: Kendrick Lamar]
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Won't you look to your left and right? Make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propellin'
Let my words be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And with that—
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Do you believe in me? How much you believe in her?
You think she gon' stick around if them 25 years occur?
You think he can hold you down when you down behind bars, hurt?
You think y'all on common ground if you promise to be the first?
Can you be immortalized without your life being expired?
Even though y'all share the same blood, is it worth the time?
Like, who got your best interest? Like, how much are you dependent?
How clutch are the people that say they love you and who pretending?
How tough is your skin when they turn you in? Do you show forgiveness?
What brush do you bend when dusting your shoulders from being offended?
What kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissing?
What kind of bridge did they burn? Revenge on your mind when it's mentioned
You wanna love like Nelson, you wanna be like Nelson
You wanna walk in his shoes, but your peacemaking seldom
You wanna be remembered that delivered the message
That considered the blessing of everyone
This your lesson for everyone, say:
[Refrain: Kendrick Lamar]
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Won't you look to your left and right? Make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
The voice of Mandela, hope this flow stay propellin'
Let my word be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And if you riding with me, nigga—
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I been wrote off before, I got abandonment issues
I hold grudges like bad judges, don't let me resent you
That's not Nelson-like—want you to love me like Nelson
I went to Robben's Island analysing; that's where his cell is
So I could find clarity—like, how much you cherish me?
Is this relationship a fake, or real as the heavens be?
See, I got to question it all; family, friends, fans, cats, dogs
Trees, plants, grass, how the wind blow, Murphy's Law
Generation X—will I ever be your ex?
Flaws of a baby step', mauled by the mouth of Pit bulls
Put me under stress, crawled under rocks, duckin' y'all
It's respect, but then tomorrow, put my back against the wall
How many leaders you said you needed, then left 'em for dead?
Is it Moses? Is it Huey Newton or Detroit Red?
Is it Martin Luther? JFK? Shooter—you assassin
Is it Jackie? Is it Jesse? Oh, I know it's Michael Jackson—oh
[Refrain: Kendrick Lamar]
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
That nigga gave us ""Billie Jean,"" you say he touched those kids?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propelling
Let my word be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And if you riding with me, nigga, let me ask this question, nigga
[
Spoken Outro:
 
Kendrick Lamar & 
2Pac
]
""I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
But that didn't stop survivor's guilt
Going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city
I was entering a new one
A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination
Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned
The word was respect
Just because you wore a different gang color than mine's
Doesn't mean I can't respect you as a black man
Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets
If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us
But I don't know, I'm no mortal man
Maybe I'm just another nigga""
Shit and that's all I wrote
I was gonna call it ""Another Nigga,"" but it ain't really a poem
I just felt like it's something you probably could relate to
Other than that, now that I finally got a chance to holla at you
I always wanted to ask you about a certain situa—
About a metaphor, actually, uh, you spoke on the ground
What you mean by that? What the ground represent?
The ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil
Right
That's how I see it, my word is bond
I see—and the ground is the symbol for the poor people
Right
The poor people is gonna open up this whole world
And swallow up the rich people
'Cause the rich people gonna be so fat
 (Mhm)
And they gonna be so appetizing
 (Mhm)
You know what I'm saying, wealthy
 (Right), 
appetizing
 (Hungry)
The poor gonna be so poor, and hungry
Right
You know what I'm saying, it's gonna be like
You know what I'm saying, it's gonna be
There might—, there might be some cannibalism out this muhfu—
They might eat the rich, you know what I'm saying?
A'ight, so let me ask you this, then
Do you see yourself as somebody that's rich
Or somebody that made the best of they own opportunities?
I see myself as a natural-born hustler
A true hustler in every sense of the word
I took nothin', I took the opportunities
I worked at the m-most menial and degrading job
And built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it
I-I went from having somebody managing me
To me hiring the person that works my management company
 (Right)
I changed everything, I realized my destiny
In a matter of five years, you know what I'm saying?
I made myself a millionaire
 (Right), 
I made—, I made millions for a lot of people
Now it's time to make millions for myself, you know what I'm saying
?
I made millions for the record companies
 (Mhm)
I made millions for these movie companies
 (Mhm)
Now I make millions for, for us
 (Mmm)
And through your different avenues of success
How would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity?
By my faith in God
, 
by my faith in the game
And by my faith in ""all good—, all good things come to those that stay true""
Right
You know what I'm saying?
And it was happening to me for a reason
You know what I'm saying, I was noticing, shit
I was punching the right buttons and it was happening
So, it's no problem, you know
I mean, it's a problem, but I'm not finna let them know
 (Hmm)
I'm finna go straight through
Would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that, huh
Somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall?
Shit, I like to think that at every opportunity I've ever been, uh, threatened with resistance, it's been met with resistance
And not only me, but it goes down my family tree
You know what I'm saying, it's in my veins to fight back
Aight, well, how long will you think it take before niggas be like
""We fighting a war, I'm fighting a war I can't win
And I wanna lay it all down""
In this country, a Black man only have like
Five years we can exhibit maximum strength
And that's right now while you a teenager, while you still strong
While you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back
'Cause once you turn thirty it's like
They take the heart and soul out of a man
Out of a Black man in this country
And you don't wanna fight no more
And if you don't believe me, you can look around
You don't see no loud mouth thirty-year old motherfuckers
 (Mhm)
That's crazy, because me, being one of your offsprings of the legacy you left behind
I can truly tell you that there's nothing but turmoil goin' on so, I want to ask you
What you think is the future for me and my generation today?
I think that niggas is tired of grabbin' shit out the stores
And next time it's a riot it's gonna be like, uh, bloodshed, for real
I don't think America know that
I think America think we was just playing
And it's gonna be some more playing but
It ain't gonna be no playing
It's gonna be murder, you know what I'm saying?
It's gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831
 (Mhm), 
up in this motherfucker
You know what I'm saying, it's gonna happen
 (Mmm)
That's crazy, man, in my opinion
Only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations
A lot of people don't understand how important it is, you know
Sometimes I can like, get behind a mic and I don't know what type of energy
I'ma push out or where it comes from
Trip me out sometimes
Because it's spirits, we ain't even really rappin'
We just letting our dead homies tell stories for us
 (Damn)
I wanted to read one last thing to you
It's actually something a good friend had wrote
Describing my world
It says:
“The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it
Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it
In order to protect itself from this mad city
While consuming its environment
The caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive
One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him
But praises the butterfly
The butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness
And the beauty within the caterpillar
But having a harsh outlook on life
The caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak
And figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits
Already surrounded by this mad city
The caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon
Which institutionalizes him
He can no longer see past his own thoughts, he's trapped
When trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root, such as
Going home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city
The result?
Wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant
Finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations
That the caterpillar never considered
Ending the internal struggle
Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different
They are one and the same""
What's your perspective on that?

The excerpts of 2Pac’s conversation with Kendrick were taken from a 1994 interview with the Swedish radio show P3 Soul, hosted by Mats Nileskär.

[Verse 1]
I never ask you where you go
After I leave you in the morning
We go our different ways
To separate situations
It's not that easy anymore
[Verse 2]
Today I do what must be done
I give my time to total strangers
But now it feels as though
The day goes on forever
More than it ever did before
[Chorus]
Until the night, until the night
Oh, I just might make it
Until the night, until the night
When I see you again
[Verse 3]
Now you're afraid that we have changed
And I'm afraid we're getting older
So many broken hearts
So many lonely faces
So many lovers
Come and gone[Verse 4]
I'll have my fears like every man
You'll have your tears like every woman
Today we'll be unsure
Is this what we believe in?
And wonder how can we go on?
[Chorus]
Until the night, until the night
Oh, I just might make it
Until the night, until the night
When I see you again
[Verse 5]
Mmm, mmm
Mmmm, mmmm
When the sun goes down and the day is over
When the last of the light has gone
As they pour into the street I will be getting closer (closer)
As the cars turn their headlights on
[Interlude]
As they're closing it down
I'm gonna open it up
And while they're going to sleep
We'll just be starting to touch[Bridge]
I'm just beginning to feel
I'm just beginning to give
I'm just beginning to feel
I'm just beginning to live
Before I leave you again
Before the light of the dawn
Before this evening can end
I have been waiting so long

I just might make it
Until the night, until the night
I'll just keep holding on

Heat Lyrics
50 Cent assures us, via hard lyrics and a Dr. Dre beat built off gunshots, that even if he’s famous, rich, and selling records, he’ll still bust a cap in your ass.
[Skit]
Ayy, you want some of this shit?
Nah, I don't want that shit
I don't give a fuck
I don't play that shit, and I'm finna buss a cap in a nigga
Man, shut the fuck up!
Slow down, slow down, slow down
You see that brick house right there? That's the nigga crib
When he come out you gotta tighten his ass up
I'ma get in the other car
Aight
[Chorus]
If there's beef, 
cock it and dump it
, the drama really means nothin'
To me, I'll ride by and blow your brains out (Brains out)
There's no time to cock it, no way you can stop it
When niggas run up on you with them thangs out (Thangs out)
I do what I gotta do, I don't care I if get caught
The DA can play this motherfuckin' tape in court
I'll kill you, I ain't playin'
Hear what I'm sayin', homie, I ain't playin'
Catch you slippin', I'ma kill you, I ain't playin'
Hear what I'm saying, homie, I ain't playin'
[Verse 1]
Keep thinking I'm candy
 'til your fucking skull get popped
And your brain hop out the top like Jack-in-the-box (Yeah)
In the hood, summertime is the killing season
It's hot out this bitch, that's a good enough reason (Woo)
I've seen gangstas get religious when they start bleeding
Saying ""Lord, Jesus help me"" 'cause they ass leaking
When that window roll down and that AK come out
You can squeeze your little handgun 'til you run out
And you can run for your backup
But them machine gun shells gon' tear your back up
God's on your side? Shit, I'm aight with that
'Cause we gon' reload them clips and come right back
It's a fact, homie, you go against me, you're fucked
I get the drop, if you can duck, you're luckier than Lady Luck
Look, nigga, don't think you safe 'cause you moved out the hood
'Cause your mama still around, dawg, and that ain't good
If you was smart, you'd be shook of me
'Cause I'll get tired of looking for you, spray your mama crib and let your ass look for me[Chorus]
If there's beef, cock it and dump it, the drama really means nothin'
To me, I'll ride by and blow your brains out (Brains out)
There's no time to cock it, no way you can stop it
When niggas run up on you with them thangs out (Thangs out)
I do what I gotta do, I don't care I if get caught
The DA can play this motherfuckin' tape in court
I'll kill you, I ain't playin'
Hear what I'm sayin', homie, I ain't playin'
Catch you slippin', I'ma kill you, I ain't playin'
Hear what I'm saying, homie, I ain't playin'
[Verse 2]
My heart bleeds for you, nigga, I can't wait to get to you
Behind that twinkle in your eyes, I can see the bitch in you
Nigga, you know the streets talk
So there'll be no white flags and no peace talks
I got my back against the wind, I'm down to ride 'til the sun burn out
If I die today I'm happy how my life turned out
See the shootouts, I done been in 'em by myself
Locked up, I was in a box by myself
I done made myself a millionaire by myself
Now shit changed, motherfucker, I can hire some help
I done heard about the fifty grand you put in the hood
But your shooter finna get shot, it won't do him no good
With a pistol, I define the definition of pain
If you survive, your bones'll still fucking hurt when it rains
Oh, you a pro at playing Battleship? Well, this ain't the same
Little homie, this is a whole different type of war game
See, the losers end up in shackles and motherfucking chains
Or laid out in the street, leaking out they brains[Chorus]
If there's beef, cock it and dump it, the drama really means nothin'
To me, I'll ride by and blow your brains out (Brains out)
There's no time to cock it, no way you can stop it
When niggas run up on you with them thangs out (Thangs out)
I do what I gotta do, I don't care I if get caught
The DA can play this motherfuckin' tape in court
I'll kill you, I ain't playin'
Hear what I'm sayin', homie, I ain't playin'
Catch you slippin', I'ma kill you, I ain't playin'
Hear what I'm saying, homie, I ain't playin'
[Bridge]
After the fist fights it's gunfire, boy, you get the best of me (Best of me)
If you don't wanna get shot, I suggest you don't go testing me (Testing me)
All the wrong I've done, the Lord still keep on blessing me (Blessing me)
Finna run rap 'cause Dr. Dre got the recipe (Recipe, recipe)
[Outro]
Yeah, haha, ayy, Dre
You got me feeling real bulletproof up in this motherfucker
'Cause the windows on my motherfucking Benz is bulletproof, nigga
'Cause my motherfucking vest is bulletproof, nigga
'Cause my motherfucking hat is bulletproof, nigga
But the Doc said if I get hit, I might get a fucking concussion
But better that than a hole in the head right, nigga? Hahahaha",https://genius.com/50-cent-heat-lyrics,"",""

I can show you strong, I can fight for you
I can try to move mountains if you want me to

But, baby, I ain't Wonder Woman

There's a reason why you only see it in the movies[Chorus]

Paranoid Android Lyrics
“Paranoid Android,” the first single from OK Computer, is characterized by three distinct moods written in what Thom Yorke referred to as three different states of mind. The song’s lyrics tie in with a number…

[Verse 1]
Please, could you stop the noise?
I'm trying to get some rest
From all the unborn chicken voices
In my head
[Chorus]
What's that?
(I may be paranoid, but not an android)
What's that?
(I may be paranoid, but not an android)
[Verse 2]
When I am king
You will be first against the wall
With your opinion
Which is of no consequence at all
[Chorus]
What's that?
(I may be paranoid, but no android)
What's that?
(I may be paranoid, but no android)
[Bridge 1]
Ambition makes you look pretty ugly
Kicking, squealing, Gucci little piggy
You don't remember, you don't remember
Why don't you remember my name?
Off with his head, man, off with his head, man
Why don't you remember my name?
I guess he does[Bridge 2]
Rain down, rain down
Come on, rain down on me
From a great height
From a great height, height
Rain down, rain down
Come on, rain down on me
From a great height
From a great height, height
That's it, sir, you're leaving (Rain down)
The crackle of pigskin (Rain down)
The dust and the screaming (Come on, rain down)
The yuppies networking (On me)
The panic, the vomit (From a great height)
The panic, the vomit (From a great height)

Its release marked the start of Radiohead's reputation as art rock innovators, and the album subsequently received huge acclaim. This song has garnered a reputation for being Radiohead's greatest work and one of the best rock songs of all time. The song's structure, though unique among Radiohead material, was also responsible for most of the comparisons with 1970s progressive rock that the band subsequently earned.

This song was inspired by some events that Thom Yorke witnessed at and after a star studded awards show. The lyrics ""kicking, screaming, Gucci little piggy"" are one of the more obvious references.

Singer Thom Yorke often refers to it as a ""joke"" song, though not derisively; the band continues to play it live at nearly every concert, usually toward the end of the set. The song's title refers to the depressed robot Marvin the Paranoid Android from Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

""Paranoid Android"" was recorded in actress Jane Seymour's fifteenth-century mansion, a house that Yorke was convinced was haunted. Bassist Colin Greenwood said ""On 'Paranoid Android' what we were into was the idea of a DJ Shadow meets The Beatles thing."" Thom Yorke also compared the song to The Beatles' work, saying ""it really started out as three separate songs and we didn't know what to do with them. Then we thought of 'Happiness Is a Warm Gun' — which was obviously three different bits that John Lennon put together — and said 'Why don't we try that?'""

Early versions of the song performed in 1996 had a different structure and varying lyrics. According to members of the band, ""Paranoid Android"" originally exceeded 10 minutes. It is unknown whether this long version, also fabled to include organ solos, was ever played live. However, it was possibly played by Radiohead at the Rock Werchter Festival in Belgium in July 1996, apparently the song's first live performance.

One month later, Radiohead began a brief tour as opening band for Alanis Morissette, in which they premiered many new songs that would go on to make up ""OK Computer"", and played ""Paranoid Android"" regularly. By this point, the song was six to eight minutes long, without extended organ solos. However, the ending differed markedly from the final version of ""Paranoid Android."" The third section originally had the lyrics ""Hallelujah"", where the final version has ""Rain down..."", and instead of the lyrics ""God loves his children /God loves his children, yeah,"" the final line of the song was reportedly, ""God loves his children / That's why he kills 'em, yeah,"" which was part of a different third section which also included other different lyrics and was extended longer, eventually returning to the opening theme and guitar riff of the song's first section, while the released version ultimately went straight into the final guitar solo. When played live since 1997, the song is performed as on the album, lacking these elements.

Jazz pianist Brad Mehldau has performed a cover of Paranoid Android on his album ""Largo"". It is also a live performance on his 2004 ""Live in Tokyo"" disc. Tribute and Radiohead cover albums also prominently feature the song; Christopher O'Riley's ""Hold Me to This"" features a version, as do Sia Furler on ""Exit Music: Songs with Radio Heads"" and the reggae group Easy Star All-Stars on their cover album ""Radiodread"". Los Angeles rock band Phantom Planet has also covered the song; a version of it is on their album ""Connect Sets"", and they perform it live. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/_/Paranoid+Android"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

[Verse 1]
We were talking about the space between us all
And the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth, then it's far too late when they pass away
[Verse 2]
We were talking about the love we all could share, when we find it
To try our best to hold it there with, our love
With our love, we could save the world if they only knew
[Chorus]
Try to realise it's all within yourself
No one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
We were talking about the love that's gone so cold
And the people, who gain the world and lose their soul
They don't know, they can't see, are you one of them?
[Chorus]
When you've seen beyond yourself
Then you may find, peace of mind is waiting there
And the time will come when you see we're all one
And life flows on within you and without you[Outro]

Engine make it hard to creep
Just leave the gate open, through the side door, I'ma creep (Ooh, ooh)

 And are the kids downstairs asleep?
And are you upstairs by yourself? A minute from there
Is there some room for me? Baby, do tell, do tell[Chorus]

The track shares a similar cadence to Travis' August 2018, “5% TINT” which similarly has a slow, yet fascinating rhythm. While rapping, Travis is backed by a creepy piano riff that follows him through the entire track.

With a lack of autotune — in comparison to other Travis Scott songs — the raw vocals play into the mysterious theme of the song which surrounds the topic of drugs. It sees Travis being honest, however, at the same time, he’s in denial about being on drugs. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Travis+Scott/_/I+KNOW+%3F"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Gunz Come Out Lyrics
Track #15 from Fifty’s ‘Massacre’. Dre and Elizondo are to blame for this classic beat. Back in the days when Curtis was going hard!
[Intro]
It's cold (It's cold, it's cold)
So cold (So cold, so cold)
[Chorus]
Y'all niggas know (What-what y'all niggas know?)
Know what I'm about (Y'all niggas know what I'm 'bout)
Fuck with my dough (What-what y'all niggas know?)
Then the guns come out (Then the guns come out)
Y'all niggas know (What-what y'all niggas know?)
Know what I'm about (Y'all niggas know what I'm 'bout)
Fuck with my dough (What-what y'all niggas know?)
Then the guns come out (Then the guns come out)
[Verse 1]
I do this all the time, stuck with a little shine
Walk with a 
little nine
, case I get in a bind
They say I'm fucking crazy, they think I'm out my mind
Cause I'm down to bust a nigga head all the time
Now you know the hoes, they know how I roll
In that new Rolls with the suicide doors
22 inch chrome, a nigga money long
You try to touch me, I pull out, you get your brains blown
You go against the grain, pussy and you on your own
You're entering in my zone, welcome to the terrordome
The ice blowing my chain, blood blue in my veins
Blue still in the range, I'm doing my thang
The semi-auto spray, run if you get away
We'll find your whereabouts and clap at you another day
Nigga play with the bread, get a hole in ya head
You touch a dime of mine thug and your ass dead[Chorus]
Y'all niggas know (What-what y'all niggas know?)
Know what I'm about (Y'all niggas know what I'm 'bout)
Fuck with my dough (What-what y'all niggas know?)
Then the guns come out (Then the guns come out)
Y'all niggas know (What-what y'all niggas know?)
Know what I'm about (Y'all niggas know what I'm 'bout)
Fuck with my dough (What-what y'all niggas know?)
Then the guns come out (Then the guns come out)
[Verse 2]
In the hood, hoopty, hat low, niggas don't know I'm around
Hop out, hit 'em up, lay my murder game down
You see me in ya projects, 
187's in progress
Hard niggas finna soften up when that lead touch 'em
You cut 'em once he keep fighting, fuck it just keep cutting 'em
It's real killa instinct, kill or be killed
Trust me, you don't wanna feel how hollow tips feel
Fuck around and get your cap peeled
, nigga you know the drill
Brownsville, Flatbush, Crown Heights, Brooklyn Zoo
Feed the wolves, they eat the food and the hand that feed 'em too
Nigga welcome to the jungle, New York, New York
Gangstas use sign language and let their guns talk
Look homie, I'm cool with some Bloods, I'm cool with some Crips
I'm cool but if there's a problem, nigga I got extra clips
I don't know karate, but I split the bricks
I don't love 'em lover boy, we can share a bitch[Chorus]
Y'all niggas know (What-what y'all niggas know?)
Know what I'm about (Y'all niggas know what I'm 'bout)
Fuck with my dough (What-what y'all niggas know?)
Then the guns come out (Then the guns come out)
Y'all niggas know (What-what y'all niggas know?)
Know what I'm about (Y'all niggas know what I'm 'bout)
Fuck with my dough (What-what y'all niggas know?)
Then the guns come out (Then the guns come out)
[Verse 3]
I'll come through and touch ya, walk out then cut ya
In case your dumbass wanna tussle
AR-15
, cooling system makes the shell case muffled
Scope, infrared, run you're still dead
Hit your calf, hit your ass, hit ya back, then your head
Contract killa, murder for the scrilla
Search, find a nigga, run up behind a nigga
Shoot car windows out to flatline a nigga
Gun pop, heart stop, homie this is heavy
You on your way to meet your maker, nigga are you ready
No exception to the rule, death is promised
Plus I just bought my niggas new Macs and llamas
Got respect for human life, but will accommodate you
One phone call and niggas will exterminate you
No future fucking with me, there's no tomorrow
Niggas'll run up on you tonight and hit you with hollows[Chorus]
Y'all niggas know (What-what y'all niggas know?)
Know what I'm about (Y'all niggas know what I'm 'bout)
Fuck with my dough (What-what y'all niggas know?)
Then the guns come out (Then the guns come out)
Y'all niggas know (What-what y'all niggas know?)
Know what I'm about (Y'all niggas know what I'm 'bout)
Fuck with my dough (What-what y'all niggas know?)

Composition:

""Do You Want to Know a Secret"" was primarily written by John Lennon, but credited to Lennon/McCartney.The song was inspired by ""I'm Wishing"", a tune from Walt Disney’s 1937 animated film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs which Lennon's mother, Julia Lennon, would sing to him as a child. The first two lines of the song in Disney's movie (""Want to know a secret? Promise not to tell?"") come right after the opening lyrics (""You'll never know how much I really love you... You'll never know how much I really care...""). McCartney said it was a ""50-50 collaboration written to order,"" i.e., for Harrison to sing.

Recording:

In 1980, Lennon said that he gave ""Do You Want to Know a Secret"" to Harrison to sing because ""it only had three notes and he wasn't the best singer in the world,"" but added ""he has improved a lot since then."" Harrison sang two songs on Please Please Me, this song by Lennon and McCartney and ""Chains"" by Goffin/King. The Beatles did not record a song composed solely by Harrison until ""Don't Bother Me"" on With The Beatles.
The song was recorded during a ten-hour session on 11 February 1963 along with nine other songs for Please Please Me.

George Harrison - lead guitar, lead vocals

[Verse 1]
All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again, but not this time around
[Chorus]
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry (No, no, no, no)
[Verse 2]
You're looking so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you've got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know, oh
And now, you're asking me to listen 'cause it's worked each time before

But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry

You're not sorry (No, no, no, no)
You're not sorry (No, no, no, no)[Bridge]
You had me crawling for you, honey, and it never would've gone away, no
You used to shine so bright, but I watched all of it fade

So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry

[Verse 1]
If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we 
fell into
 a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time
[Pre-Chorus]
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Chorus]
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
You, moonlight, you're my starlight (
You're the 
moonlight
)
I need you all night, 
come on
, dance with me
I'm levitating
[Verse 2]
I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see us written in the stars
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever every time we get together
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars[Pre-Chorus]
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You can fly away with me tonight
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride

[Bridge]
My love is like a rocket, watch it blast off
And I'm feeling so electric, dance my ass off
And even if I wanted to, I can't stop
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My love is like a rocket, watch it blast off
And I'm feeling so electric, dance my ass off
And even if I wanted to, I can't stop

Goodbye Girl Lyrics
Yeah, I know that color on your lips too well
I saw you blowing kisses down the wishing well again
When I say I love you, just just say ""I know.""
You put your arms around me, but it's all for show
And then, there you go wrecking my whole world
All fixed up, my goodbye girl
You scatter in the wind just like a dandelion
Reminding me again that you ain't ever mine for long
But I know it's gonna happen when the moon is right
You'll show up at my door and pull me in just like a song
There you go, wrecking my whole world
One more hello, one more goodbye, girl
It might seem crazy to keep loving you this way
But I'll never bring myself to say goodbye, girl
The sun is gonna make it's way around again
But the rain is always waiting just around the bend
And there you go, wrecking my whole world
One more hello, one more goodbye, girl
All fixed up, my goodbye girl
Goodbye girl

Silver Lining Lyrics
Kacey playfully weaves a series of familiar idioms, each with an added twist, to show the importance of optimism and hard work in chasing one’s dream.
[Verse 1]
Woke up on the wrong side of rock bottom
You're all out of pennies, and the well, it done run dry
You'd light 'em up and smoke 'em if you had 'em, but you just ain't got 'em
Yeah, ain't we always lookin' for a bluer sky?
[Chorus 1]
But if you're ever gonna find a silver lining
It's gotta be a cloudy day
It's gotta be a cloudy day
If you wanna fill your bottle up with lightning
You're gonna have to stand in the rain
You're gonna have to stand in the rain
[Post-Chorus]
Hoo-hoo-hoo
Hoo-hoo-hoo
Hoo-hoo-hoo
Hoo
[Verse 2]
Lemonade keeps turnin' into lemons
And you wear your heart on a ripped, unraveled sleeve
Been run through the wringer and pushed plum to your limit
You say you're just unlucky, but luck ain't what you need[Chorus 2]
'Cause if you're ever gonna find a four-leaf clover
You gotta get a little dirt on your hands
You gotta get a little dirt on your hands
And if you wanna find a head that fits your shoulder
You're gonna have to go to the dance
You're gonna have to go to the dance
[Bridge]
If you wanna find the honey
You can't be scared of the bees
And if you wanna see the forest
You're gonna have to look past the trees

If you're ever gonna find a silver lining
It's gotta be a cloudy day
Yeah, it's gotta be a cloudy day
Ooh, and if you wanna fill your bottle up with lightning

You're gonna have to stand in the rain

Golden G String Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I woke up in Montecito
I was thinkin' about my life
And the questions made more questions
Starin' out into the night
Yes, I've worn the golden G-string
Put my hand into hellfire
I did it all to make you love me and to feel alive
[Chorus]
Oh, that's just the world that we're livin' in
The old boys hold all the cards and they ain't playin' gin
You dare to call me crazy, have you looked around this place?
I should walk away
Oh, I should walk away
But I think I'll stay
[Verse 2]
There are layers to this body
Primal sex and primal shame
They told me I should cover it
So I went the other way
I was tryin' to own my power
Still I'm tryin' to work it out
And at least it gives the paper somethin' they can write about[Chorus]
And oh, that's just the world that we're livin' in
The old boys hold all the cards and they ain't playin' gin
And you dare to call me crazy, have you looked around this place?
I should walk away
Oh, I should walk away
But I think I'll stay
[Bridge]
So the mad man's in the big chair
And his heart's an iron vault
He says ""If you can't make ends meet, honey, it must be your fault""
We all focus on the winners
And get blinded by their shine
Maybe caring for each other's just too 1969
[Chorus]
But oh, that's just the world that we're livin' in
The old boys hold all the cards and they ain't playin' gin
And you dare to call me crazy, have you looked around this place?
I should walk away
Oh, I should walk away
But I think I'll stay
[Outro]
And I think I'll stay, yeah
I have too much to lose
So I think I'll stay
I can't walk away",https://genius.com/Miley-cyrus-golden-g-string-lyrics,"""Golden G String"" is a song about creating a life of your own against the expectations of society.

Hey Jimmy, where you going?
I don't know where I'm going
My Dad died, and, uh, he left me his degrees
My mom would always say, ""Dad, why don't you work?""
But he just kept learning, hmm
All the other kids' parents were working and saving up money for school
And I was actually in school all while my dad was in school!
Even, he was so greedy with degrees, he took my degree
And now, I'm just glad he left me these
Because all the regular homeless people have newspaper, and look what I have
These are 
documented
, my father left them to me
And I'm going to leave them to my kids
I'm gonna learn too
I'm gonna get super smart, so I, too, can die without money
But I'll be the smartest dead guy!

In case you haven't noticed
Well, everybody's tired
And healin' from somebody
Or somethin' we don't see just right
[Pre-Chorus]
Boy, come on, put your lipstick on (No one can tell you nothin')
Come on and walk this way through the fire (Don't care what's on their mind)

Your energy is yours and mine is mine (It's mine, it's mine)
What's mine is mine
My face is sitting, I don't need no disguise (I don't need no disguise)
Don't comment on my body, do not reply

Why do you care so much whose **** I ride?
Why?

Grande teased the release of her seventh album in an October 2023 photo dump on her Instagram, jokingly saying the album title was Goat Mother. Also included in the photo dump were pictures of Swedish producer and longtime collaborator Max Martin. On December 7 and December 17, 2023, she shared several pictures and clips of herself and members of her team working in recording studios and editing audio files. Grande confirmed a 2024 album release via her social media on December 27, 2023.

On January 4, 2024, Grande went in public wearing a custom sweatshirt that read ""yes, and?"" to tease the lead single's title, which she had previously done for her Sweetener lead single ""no tears left to cry"". The phrase was confirmed to be the name of the lead single when Grande officially announced the song via her social media. Jem Aswad of Variety commented that ""yes, and?"" was a successor to ""thank u, next"", the title of her fifth studio album and its lead single.

""yes, and?"" is Grande's first solo musical output since Positions. Its pre-save and pre-order links for streaming services and its CD single were first shared via the Sweetener Instagram page. The artwork was partially revealed in December 2023 with a defocused close-up shot of Grande's red lips via R.E.M. Beauty packages that were sent to fans, with a note: ""See you next year"". Grande revealed its cover artwork via social media on January 7, 2024, which shows a blurry shot of the left side of her face. In it, she wears the ""On Your Collar"" classic lipstick of the red shade ""Attention"", which is a part of the R.E.M. Beauty collection. It was photographed by Katia Temkin. According to Grande, the single cover will also serve as one of the album's cover variants.

Directed by Christian Breslauer, the music video for ""yes, and?"" was released via Grande's Vevo channel on YouTube at 10:00 AM EST on January 12, ten hours after the song's release. The visual is inspired by Paula Abdul's ""Cold Hearted"" video and its ""late-'80s energy"". <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Ariana+Grande/_/yes,+and%3F"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Effortlessly Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Told you not to feel
Told you not to hurt at all
That just isn't real
That's a little cynical
Here's a little pill
There's a little fix-it-all
Okay, it's all okay
[Chorus]
But I'm still fading, I can't save me
Am I just gonna drown?
So I hold my breath to breathe
Hurt me so I feel
Used to do these things so effortlessly, somehow
[Verse 2]
Told you how to heal
Filled you up with chemicals
Sadness isn't real
Then why's it feel so physical?
Runnin' through your veins
Cutting right into the bone
Okay, it's all okay
[Chorus]
But I'm still fading, I can't save me
Am I just gonna drown?
So I hold my breath to breathe
Hurt me so I feel
Used to do these things so effortlessly, somehow[Bridge]
Hold my breath to breathe

These past years been dreaming about a life with promise
A life with passing members
Every day, about a step closer to his widest inspirations
Quiet hours before dawn
While the rest of the world still slept
Whispered to you [?]

LoveDrug Lyrics
[Intro]
(Need your love, your love drug, your love drug)
(Need your love drug)
[Verse 1]
River in my eyes, I've got a poem in my throat
I hear the music and it takes me by surprise
Pictures in my mind, they come on faster than they go
Another round, hopin' this one will make me blind
[Pre-Chorus]
I know this time
I won't escape these thoughts in my head
I need you tonight
But I'm gonna fight the feelin' instead
[Chorus]
I don't wanna feel, I don't wanna cry
So I'm gonna dance until I feel alright
I just need a dose of the right stuff
I just need a hit of your love drug
I don't wanna feel, I don't wanna cry
So I'm gonna dance until I feel alright
I just need a dose of the right stuff
I just need a hit of your love drug[Post-Chorus]
Your love drug
[Verse 2]
Thought we'd last a lifetime, when I'm mumblin' alone
I taste the last words that you spoke to me like wine
My heart is in a bind, if I could bear it on my own
I wouldn't try so hard to numb what's left behind
[Pre-Chorus]
I know this time
I won't escape these thoughts that I dread
I need you tonight
But I'm gonna fight the feelin' instead
[Chorus]
I don't wanna feel, I don't wanna cry
So I'm gonna dance until I feel alright
I just need a dose of the right stuff
I just need a hit of your love drug
I don't wanna feel, I don't wanna cry
So I'm gonna dance until I feel alright
I just need a dose of the right stuff

Johnson, and Stefan Johnson), alongside Michael Pollack and Raul Cubina.

Johnson, and Stefan Johnson), alongside Michael Pollack and Raul Cubina.

""Anyone” is an 80s- and 90s-informed arena-ready Pop track with a rhythmic pulse and a huge chorus, kind of a like a soft, fizzy, synthetic take on the sound of ""Joshua Tree""-era U2.

At the 64th Annual Grammy Awards ""Anyone"" received a nomination for Best Pop Solo Performance.

Bieber revealed on April 10, 2020, during an Instagram Live that he had recorded a song called ""Anyone"". On December 30, 2020, Bieber announced on Twitter that the song would be released on January 1, 2021. He revealed the cover art and a 15-second trailer of the song's accompanying music video the following day.

On December 31, 2020, Bieber performed his first full concert since 2017, which included the debut performance of ""Anyone"". Speaking of the song, Bieber said: ""'Anyone' is such a special, hopeful, anthemic song. It sets the tone for a brighter new year full of hope and possibility"".

""Anyone"" debuted at its peak of number two on the Canadian Hot 100 issued for January 16, 2021. Music Canada certified the song Double Platinum. On the US Billboard Hot 100, it debuted and peaked at number six; it earned a Gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), which denotes 500,000 units based on sales and track-equivalent on-demand streams. ""Anyone"" entered at number four on the UK Singles Chart, and the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) certified it Silver. In Australia, the song debuted at number five and went Platinum. It peaked at number nine in New Zealand and received a Gold certification. ""Anyone"" charted within the top 10 of national record charts, at number two in Norway, number three in Denmark, number four in Hungary, Singapore, number five in Ireland, number six in Sweden, number seven in the Netherlands, number eight in Malaysia, and number nine in Finland. It received a Platinum certification in Denmark.

The music video premiered on YouTube on January 1, 2021 at 05:00 UTC (midnight Eastern Standard Time). It was directed by American music video director and film maker Colin Tilley and stars American actress Zoey Deutch who plays Bieber's love interest in the video. Bieber portrays a 1940s boxer whose powerful love for his other half inspires him to train, fight, and eventually overcome a potential K.O. on his journey to becoming a champion. For the music video, Bieber covered up all of his tattoos.

Bieber performed the song for the first time during his New Year's Eve concert on December 31, 2020. He later performed the song on March 13, 2021, during the 2021 Kids' Choice Awards. On May 2, 2021, he performed the song on Big Brother Brasil 21.

In February 2021, American music professional Rick Beato compared ""Anyone"" to ""Goin' Home"", a song by American rock band Toto. He expressed his opinion that the choruses of the songs are written in the same key, and the melody and tempo are almost the same. Canadian radio station CKDR-FM expressed a similar opinion. American guitarist and Toto's founding member Steve Lukather accused Bieber of stealing ""Goin' Home"" in a May 2021 interview.

Optimistic Lyrics
“Optimistic,” the sixth song on the album, got more radio play than just about every other track.  It seems to feature two potential reactions to the desolation of a consumerist marketplace. The first verse…

[Verse 1]
Flies are buzzing 'round my head
Vultures circling the dead
Picking up every last crumb
The big fish eat the little ones
Big fish eat the little ones
Not my problem, give me some
[Chorus]
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
[Verse 2]
This one's optimistic
This one went to market
This one just came out of the swamp
This one drops a payload
Fodder for the animals
Living on an animal farm
[Chorus]
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough[Bridge]
I'd really like to help you, man
I'd really like to help you, man
Nervous messed up marionette
Floating 'round on a prison ship

You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can

The song hit number 10 on the Billboard modern rock charts, and one of only three Radiohead songs - the others being ""Creep"" and ""Bodysnatchers"" - to peak in the Top 10 of that chart.
""Optimistic"" was included on disc one of the 17-track, US version of Radiohead: The Best of, a compilation released by Capitol Records in 2008. The song was not included on the 16-track, UK version released by Parlophone.
""Optimistic"" was performed often during an initial tour in 2000 but it did not appear again in Radiohead's live shows until it was brought back in 2008 to be played twice at a special show for BBC Radio 1 on April 1, and again on May 4, during a VH1 exclusive concert at the Basement, London, featuring a set from their newest album In Rainbows. It has now become a regular part of the setlist on their 2008 tour. The live performance is similar to the one found on the album, featuring guitar, bass, drums, and ondes martenot, an electronic instrument played by guitarist Jonny Greenwood.
The chorus for ""Optimistic"" was directly inspired by Thom Yorke's long term partner, Rachel Owen. During the making of ""Kid A"", Thom was constantly stressed and on the verge of an emotional breakdown because of his desire to make the album as perfect as humanly possible. His partner would constantly try to calm him down by telling him that, ""the best you can is good enough"". The lyrics of the song also reference George Orwell's Animal Farm. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/_/Optimistic"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

[Verse 1]
Gotta see it to believe it, sky never looked so blue
So hard to leave it, that's what I always do
So I keep thinking back to a time under the canyon moon

The world's happy waitin', door's yellow, broken blue
I heard Jenny saying, ""Go get the kids from school""
And I keep thinking back to the time under the canyon moon
[Refrain]
I'll be gone too long from you
[Verse 3]
Staring at the ceiling, two weeks and I'll be home
Carry the feeling, through Paris, all through Rome
And I'm still thinking back to the time under the canyon moon

[Verse 1: SZA]
You are but a phoenix among feathers
You're broken by the waves among the sea
They'll let you die, they'll let you wash away
But you swim as well as you fly
[Chorus: SZA]
Pretty little bird, pretty little bird
You've hit the window a few times (The window a few times)
You're pretty little bird, pretty little bird
You still ain't scared of no heights
When the spiral down feels as good as the flight, oh
When hating you feels good for the night
When the morning comes, I hope you're still mine
[Post-Chorus: SZA]
When the morning comes
If the morning comes (I hope you're still mine)
When the morning comes
When the morning comes, I hope you're still mine (If the morning comes)
When the morning comes
If the morning comes
[Verse 2: SZA]
Told you I like gentle giants so you softened up
And you been jackin', beanin', stalkin' just to get to me, love
I wanna be your golden goose, I wanna shave my legs for you
I wanna take all of my hair down and let you lay in it
Spread all of my limbs out and let you lay in it[Chorus: SZA]
Pretty little birds, pretty little birds (Pretty little birds)
Do you mean every word? You mean every word? (Do you mean?)
Pretty little girls, pretty little girls (Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty)
We hit the window a few times (The wall, the wall)
[Post-Chorus: SZA]
Bah-da-dum-bah, but I can't stay
But I would lay
But I would (Ooh)
I would
[Verse 3: Isaiah Rashad]
Lately, I feel like I'm robbin' myself
Like I'm robbin' mines
Diamond cerebral, peek into your cortex
Be faithful and free and just play in your vortex
I see you, 'Lana, you fly by the pound (Pound)
Fly by the ounce (Ounce)
Fly to the south
Don't mind them bitches that's cleanin' my house
Lord, you can see, Lord
You see them heights that they just can't afford
I see them lights and you made for that shit
Fuck all that cryin', you pray for that shit, but[Outro: SZA & Isaiah Rashad,

I'm on an island, dirty dancin' in the sun
So close to heaven, but so far from everyone
Yeah, I've got treasures buried underneath the sand
But I'm still wishing for the love that I don't have
[Pre-Chorus]
Mama told me, ""Girl, smoke 'em if you got 'em""
Left my lighter back at home with all my problems
So I'm sittin' here wonderin' all day long

On an island? (On an island)
Or have I landed (Have I landed)
In paradise?
Am I stranded (Am I stranded)
On an island? (On an island)
Or have I landed in paradise?
[Verse 2]
I can paint my toenails whilе I'm soakin' up the sea
The only thing that's missing hеre is you and our TV
And I won't lie, it sure gets lonely here at night
But no one here needs nothin' from me, and it's kind of nice[Pre-Chorus]
Mama told me, ""Girl, smoke 'em if you got 'em""
Left my lighter back at home with all my problems
So I'm sittin' here wondering all day long

Or have I landed (You're my)
In paradise?

I hear your voice like a song on the radio

[Produced by Kanye West and Jon Brion]
[Intro]
West—Mr. West—Mr. West
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
And I heard 'em say
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow, today
From the Chi, like Tim, it's a harder way
So this is in the name of love like Robert say
Before you ask me to go get a job today
Can I at least get a raise on the minimum wage?
And I know the government administer AIDS
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
Allāhu Akbar and
 
throw in some hot cars
The things we seen on the screen is not ours
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far
Where I'm from the dope boys is the rock stars
But they can't cop cars without seeing cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars—I know it
[Chorus: Kanye West & 
Adam Levine
]
Uh, and I heard 'em say (
Ooh
)
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow, today
And I heard 'em say
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow, today
(
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow, today
)
But we'll a find a way
And nothing lasts forever, but be honest, babe
It hurts, but it may be the only way[Verse 2: Kanye West]
They say people in your life are seasons
And anything that happen is for a reason
And niggas gun clapping and keep to squeezing
And Gran' keep praying 
and keep believing
In Jesus, and one day that you see him
'Til then walk in his footsteps and try to be him
The Devil is alive, I feel him breathin'
Claiming money is the key, so keep on dreamin'
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us
My Aunt Pam can't put them cigarettes down
So now my little cousin smokin' them cigarettes now
His job try to claim that he too niggarish now
Is it 'cause his skin blacker than licorice now?
I can't figure it out, I'm sick of it now
[Chorus: Kanye West & 
Adam Levine
]
Ugh, and I heard 'em say (
Ooh
)
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow, today
And I heard 'em say
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow, today (
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow, today

[Chorus: Kanye West]
We in the streets, playa, get your mail
It's only two places you end up: either dead or in jail
Still nowhere to go
Still nowhere to go
Now throw your hands up, hustlers, busters, boosters, hoes
Everybody, fuck that!
Still nowhere to go
Still nowhere to go
[Verse 1: Mos Def]
Listen, two words: United States, no love, no breaks
Low brow,
 
high stakes

crack smoke, Black folks
Big Macs, fat folks,
 
ecstasy capsules
Presidential scandals
, 
everybody move
Two words: Mos Def, K. West, hot shit
Calm down, get back, ghetto people got this
Game 'pon lock shit, gun 'pon cock shit
We won't stop shit—everybody move!
Two words: 
B-K, N-Y, Bed-Stuy
Too harsh, too hungry, too many, that's why
These streets know game—can't ball? Don't play
Heavy traffic, one lane—everybody move!
Two words: Mos Def, 
Black Jack
, hot shit
Calm down, get back, ghetto people got this
Game 'pon lock, gun 'pon cock
We won't stop—everybody move![Chorus: Kanye West & 
Harlem Boys Choir

Now throw your hands up (
Throw your hands up high
)
Hustlers, busters, boosters, hoes
Everybody, fuck that
Still nowhere to go
Still nowhere to go
And keep your hands up (
'Til they reach the sky

Hustlers, busters, boosters, hoes
Everybody, fuck that
Still nowhere to go
(Yo, excuse me, dawg)
Still nowhere to go
(I apologize for the Westside, we finna get it jukin')
Ayo
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Two words: Chi-Town, Southside, worldwide
'Cause I rep that 'til I fuckin' die
One neck, two chains,
 one waist, 
two gats
One wall, twenty plaques, 
dues paid, gimme that
I am limelight,
 
Blueprint
, five mics
Go-Getters rhyme like should've been signed twice
Most imitated,
 
Grammy nominated
Hotel accommodated
, 
cheerleader prom-dated
Barbershop player-hated, 
mom-and-pop bootlegged it
Felt like it rained 'til the roof caved in
Two words: Chi-Town raised me, crazy
So I live by two words: ""Fuck you, pay me""
Screaming, ""Jesus, save me""
You know how the game be, I can't let 'em change me
'Cause on judgment day, you gon' blame me
Look, God—it's the same me
And I basically know now, we get racially profiled
'Cuffed up and hosed down, pimped up and ho'd down
Plus, I got a whole city to hold down
From the bottom, so the top's the only place to go now[Chorus: Kanye West & Harlem Boys Choir]
Now throw your hands up (
Til' they reach the sky
)
Hustlers, busters, boosters, hoes
Everybody, fuck that
Still nowhere to go
Still nowhere to go
[Verse 3: Freeway]
Two words: Freeway; two letters: A-R
Turn y'all rap niggas to two words: fast runners
Like Jackie Joyner
, you better sleep with your burner
The heat skeet, 
blow a reef through your car,
 my God
Two words: no guns, break arms
Break necks, break backs, Steven Seagal
Free, young boss, 
freshman of the Roc
With the beef in the pot, Jay sent for his dogs to brawl
Forget your squad, better 'fend for yourself
Have you screamin' out four words: ""Send for the law,"" ugh
Two words: Freeway, slightly retarded
Fuck around, throw a clip in your artist, leave with his broad

You know it's the almighty Black Jack

Throw your hands up

Mos Def, K. West (
Throw your hands up

Ghetto people, get this shit off your chest (
Throw your hands up

A cinematic version of the song was released as part of The College Dropout Video Anthology. It has been performed by Freeway regularly at his live shows over the years. An orchestral sound is used in the song. The music video was released in March 2005.

The three drop this fast-paced track dedicated to the titular purpose: the verses are done with two words (or two stressed syllables) for every beat (a quarter of a bar).

Kanye spoke about the song in an interview:

“When you hear “Two Words,” and you hear after my second verse and that choir goes up but the choir starts before my verse is over because I just had to keep spitting, and the choir goes up to the second part, and that little 14 year old boy hits that crescendo note before it gets to Freeway’s verse, and the piano sprinkles behind Freeway’s verse, and after Freeway’s verse we don’t go to the original chorus but we go to an amp out that a choir would do for real, “Throw your hands up, throw your hands up, throw your hands up, throw your hands up.”

When you think about the $10,000 I spent on them, and I had to go to someplace in the Hamptons, or near the Hamptons, that looked like Camp Crystal Lake off a scary movie, and round the Harlem Boys Choir up after the label had countlessly never listened to me, and then finally listened to me and tried to force me to get the Hezekiah Walker Choir because they are only $3500 but after they did it, it wasn’t really good, and I was set on getting the Harlem Boys Choir.
I got those 16 boys all in the room and designed that whole track for them to sing that, and the way Mos Def’s voice sounds on that, “Red! Black! Green! Motherfuckers, get back,” and the way we put an effect on the piano so it sounds like it’s an electric guitar but it’s not, it’s just like an amp driven guitar, and it hits the crescendo at the end so it’s like three endings. I do that on so many formats. I gave you three endings on the “Through the Wire” video. I gave you three endings on “Two Words.” And then I hear that and they gave me 4 out of 5.“ <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Kanye+West/_/Two+Words"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

PROTECTOR Lyrics
[Intro: Rumi Carter]
Mom, can I hear the lullaby?
Please?
[Verse 1]
And there I was, tangled up in marigold
We were listenin' to the reverent children singin'
(Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing) Huh, yeah
Hummin' low as the garden river flows
While the August light becomes a golden evenin'
(Evenin') Yeah

And I will lead you down that road if you lose your way
Born to be a protector
, mm-hmm
Even though I know, someday, you're gonna shine on your own
I will be your projector, mm, mm-hmm
[Verse 2]
An apricot picked right off a
 
givin' tree
I gave water to thе soil
And now it feeds me, yeah, yeah (Yеah)
And there you are, shaded underneath it all
I feel proud of who I am
Because you need me, yeah (Yeah)[Chorus]
And I will lead you down that road if you lose your way (Uh)
Born to be a protector (—tor), mm

I will be your projector

And even though I know, someday, you're gonna shine on your own
I will be your projector, projector, projector

I first saw your face in your father's gaze
There's a long line of hands carryin' your name, mm
Liftin' you up, so you will be raised

I will be your projector, hey-yeah
And even though I know, someday, you're gonna shine on your own

[Skit: 50 Cent & 
Lloyd Banks
]
Damn, you gotta go 
get
 somethin' to eat, man
I'm hungrier than a motherf
ucker, man
Ayo, man
Damn, what's takin' homie so long, son?
50, calm 
down
, man, he coming
Ah (
Oh, what the fuck?
)
Ah, son, pull off, pull off
[Intro: 50 Cent]
Many men wish death upon me
Blood in my eye, dog, and I can't see
I'm tryin' to be what I'm destined to be
And niggas tryin' to take my life away (Come on)
I put a hole in a nigga for fuckin' with me
My back on the wall, now you gon' see
Better watch how you talk when you talk about me
'Cause I'll come and take your life away
[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Now man, these pussy niggas puttin' money on my head
Go on and get your refund, motherfucker, I ain't dead
I'm the diamond in the dirt that ain't been found
I'm the underground king and I ain't been crowned
When I rhyme, somethin' special happened every time
I'm the greatest, somethin' like Ali in his prime
I walk the block with the bundles, I've been knocked on the humble
Swing the ox when I rumble
, show your ass what my gun do
Got a temper, nigga, go 'head, lose your head
Turn your back on me, get clapped and lose your legs
I walk around, gun on my waist, chip on my shoulder
'Til I bust a clip in your face, pussy, this beef ain't over
[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Sunny days wouldn't be special if it wasn't for rain
Joy wouldn't feel so good if it wasn't for pain
Death gotta be easy, 'cause life is hard
It'll leave you physically, mentally, and emotionally scarred
This is for my niggas on the block twistin' trees in cigars
For the niggas on lock doin' life behind bars
I don't say, ""Only God can judge me,"" 'cause I see things clear
Crooked-ass crackers will give my Black ass a hundred years
I'm like Paulie in 
GoodFellas
, you can call me the Don
Like Malcolm by any means with my gun in my palm
Slim switched sides on me, let niggas ride on me
I thought we was cool, why you want me to die, homie? (Homie)
[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Every night I talk to God, but he don't say nothin' back
I know he protectin' me, but I still stay with my gat
In my nightmares, niggas keep pullin' TECs on me
Psychic says some bitch done put a hex on me
The feds didn't know much when Pac got shot
I got a kite from the pens that told me Tut got knocked
I ain't gon' spell it out for you motherfuckers all the time
Are you illiterate, nigga? You can't read between the lines?
In the Bible, it says what goes around, comes around
Hommo shot me, three weeks later he got shot down
Now it's clear that I'm here for a real reason
'Cause he got hit like I got hit, but he ain't fuckin' breathin'
[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold

Joy of My Life Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I tiptoed in the room
I know you got to have your rest
She says, ""Come lay beside me
I been waitin' since you left""
[Chorus]
She's sweet to me
Must be the luckiest man alive
Did I tell you, baby
You are the joy of my life?
[Verse 2]
The first time that I saw you
Mmm, you took my breath away
I might not get to Heaven
But I walked with the angels that day
[Chorus]
She takes me by the hand
I am the luckiest man alive
Did I tell you, baby
You are the joy of my life?
[Verse 3]
Some may have their riches
Some may have their worldly things
As long as I have you
I'll treasure each and every day[Chorus]
Just take me by the hand

You are the joy of my life?",https://genius.com/Chris-stapleton-joy-of-my-life-lyrics,"",""

[Verse 1]
It was one of those nights when you turn off the lights
And everythin' comes into view
She was takin' her time, I was losing my mind
There was nothin' that she wouldn't do
[Pre-Chorus]
It wasn't the first, it wasn't the last
She knew we was makin' love
I was so satisfied deep down inside
Like a hand in a velvet glove
[Chorus]
Seems like a touch
A touch too much
Seems like a touch
A touch too much
Too much for my body, too much for my brain
This damn woman's gonna drive me insane
She got a touch
A touch too much
Yeah
[Verse 2]
Oh, she had the face of an angel, smilin' with sin
A body of Venus with arms
Dealin' with danger strokin' my skin
Like a thunder and lightnin' storm[Pre-Chorus]
It wasn't the first, it wasn't the last
It wasn't that she didn't care
She wanted it hard and wanted it fast
She liked it done medium rare
[Chorus]
Seems like a touch
A touch too much
Seems like a touch
A touch too much
Too much from my body, too much from my brain
This damn woman's going to drive me insane
She got a touch
A touch too much
Touch me
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
Seems like a touch (
Touch too much
)
You know it's much too much (
Much too much
)
I really want to feel you (
Touch too much
)
Girl, you know you're givin' me (
Much too much
)
Oh, seems like a touch
Just a dirty little touch
I really need your touch
'Cause you're much too much, too much, too much[Chorus]
Seems like a touch
A touch too much
Seems like a touch
A touch too much
Givin' me a touch
A touch too much
Lay me down and touch
A touch too much

A touch too much
A touch too much

The band had earlier recorded another song with vastly different words and music entitled ""Touch Too Much"", but the song was never released. That track would eventually see the light of day in 1997 when it was included in Volts, part of the band's Bonfire box set.

The cover of the single in many territories was released with the band photograph flipped horizontally, incorrectly showing the Youngs and bassist Cliff Williams as playing left-handed.

The music video was live rehearsal performance from If You Want Blood Tour 1978-1979, along with ""Walk All Over You"" on the Family Jewels DVD compilation.

Prior to joining AC/DC on the Rock or Bust World Tour, Axl Rose said this was his favorite AC/DC song. The song was first performed live on 22 May 2016 in Prague. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/AC%2FDC/_/Touch+Too+Much"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Mmm

I was too damn determined
Rap game, it needed refurbish
I was on top with no service
Watch as they all playin' verses
They in the bushes, they lurkin'
Might gotta call the insurgents
She wanna fuck with a purpose
I gotta juggle my urges
Got a couple departments
Closet built like a department
Double up cup of the bourbon
How I give all of my sermons
Yeah, we still (Still)
Do things down to detail
Diva and the devil
Both them bad as he-ell
They get quiet when he yell (He yell)
Can't silent my people

​cherry blossom Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Early April, you walked up to me
Changing colors on city streets
Petals surrounding us in every shade of pink
We happened quickly, as humans do
Summer was coming and change was, too
Look at me now, I'm falling at your feet

I'm your cherry blossom, baby
Don't let me blow away
I hope you haven't forgotten
Tokyo wasn't built in a day
I'm your cherry blossom, baby
I don't wanna blow away

When we're on fire, it's something to see
No one can question the chemistry
Even in nature, timing is everything

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
I hear a lot about sinners
Don't think that I'll be a saint
But I might go down to the river
'Cause the way that the sky opens up when we touch
Yeah, it's makin' me say
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy
[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
I don't do well with the drama
And, no, I can't stand it being fake
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
I don't believe in nirvana
But the way that we love in the night gave me life
Baby, I can't explain
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy[Bridge: Justin Bieber &

]
They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, ""Don't go crushin'""
Wise men say fools rush in
But I don't know (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, ""Don't go crushin'""
Wise men say fools rush in
But I don't know

[Verse 3: Chance the Rapper]
The first step pleases the Father
Might be the hardest to take
But when you come out of the water
I'm a believer, my heart is fleshy
Life is short with a temper like Joe Pesci
They always come and sing your praises, your name is catchy
But they don't see you how I see you, Parlay and Desi
Cross, Tween, Tween, Hesi' hit the jet speed
When they get messy, go lefty like Lionel Messi
Let's take a trip and get the Vespas or rent a Jet Ski
I know the spots that got the best weed, we goin' next week
I wanna honor, wanna honor you, bride's groom, I'm my father's child
I know when the son takes the first steps, the Father's proud (Yes)
If you make it to the water, He'll part the clouds (Uh)
I know He made you a snack like Oscar Proud (Mwah)
Suffer it to be so now gotta clean it up (Ooh)
Formalize the union in communion, He can trust (Woo)
I know I ain't leavin' you like I know He ain't leavin' us (Ah)
I know we believe in God, and I know God believes in us[Chorus: Justin Bieber]

Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second, on God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second, on God

Weird Fishes/Arpeggi Lyrics
“Weird Fishes/ Arpeggi” brandishes new drums behind its drain-circling arpeggios, but sounds every bit as massive in crescendoing as its live renditions suggested it might.
[Verse 1]
In the deepest ocean
The bottom of the sea
Your eyes
They turn me
Why should I stay here?
Why should I stay?
[Verse 2]
I'd be crazy not to follow
Follow where you lead
Your eyes
They turn me
Turn me into phantoms (Way out)
I follow to the edge (Way out)
Of the earth (Way out)
And fall off
Yeah, everybody leaves (Way out)
If they get the chance (Way out)
And this (Way out)
Is my chance
[Chorus]
I get eaten by the worms
And weird fishes
Picked over by the worms
And weird fishes
Weird fishes
Weird fishes[Instrumental Break]

Yeah, I
I hit the bottom
Hit the bottom and escape

It was first performed by guitarist Jonny Greenwood and lead singer Thom Yorke in 2005 as an atmospheric string-based piece, backed by the Nazareth Orchestra . In 2006, the song was brought into a rock music setting, and a full-band version was premiered which included a driving rock beat. On October 1, 2007 the band announced that the song would appear on In Rainbows as the fourth track. The version that appears on the album is similar to the 2006 version with Phil Selway's driving drum beat, although it retains many of the atmospheric, bubbly qualities of the 2005 version.

The structure has changed since the 2006 tour. The final bridge was originally used as an introduction prior to the drums starting in the song. It now starts immediately at the verse.

This song is written in a dorian mode, which gives it the ""floating"" kind of vibe that it has. The chords are all diatonic to the key of D, but Dmaj is not played at any time during the song. The song is actually based around Em7, which would make it in the key of E dorian.

The first note Thom sings and which he returns to frequently in the melody, is a D, but they dont play a tonic (D) chord under it at any point, giving it a ""deceptive"" cadence.

This song was #17 on Rolling Stone's list of the 100 Best Songs of 2007. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/_/Weird+Fishes%2FArpeggi"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."

[Skit: Rosie Watson]
Stop thinking of this as being money
""It's just money, I'ma make more""
No, no, no-no-no-no
Please decondition yourself
It's not just money, it's happiness
It's the difference between happy, being happy and sad
It's the difference between having a home and living on the streets
That's what it is, it's not just money
It's so much more than that
Right now, it's the difference between you being able to go to a prom and disappointing a girl
As I told you from the beginning, I don't have money
I have bills to pay, but that meant nothing to you, absolutely nothing
Hmm, let's see, I have

Meant nothing to you

Take It Out On Me Lyrics
[Intro]
Kid
You can take it out on me
You can take it out on me
[Verse 1]
Sometimes I don't mind you havin' the worst day
Oh, no, I don't
All the stress turns into built-up energy
Yes, it does
On the edge, I'm your net, go on and fall back
Easy on that pressure point, I love to push that
Let your frustrations out right here
I'm your psychiatrist, let's talk about it
We can use sign language, I know your body
I see the weight weighin' on your shoulders
It's so heavy
Let me be the meaning of your composure
Oh, oh
[Chorus]
You can take it out on me
You can take it out on me
I'll be your punching bag, hit me with all of your might
And get it all out 'til you feel light
And take it out on me
You can take it out on me[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'm your plug
Whatever you need, I'll make sure you get enough
And when your battery gets low
I'ma be the one to charge you up
Let me massage your mental and your physical
Whenever you lose doubt, I'll be your miracle
When you're around me, you should feel invincible
Please don't forget that
[Chorus]
You can take it out on me, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
You can take it out on me, hey, hey, hey, hey
I'll be your punching bag, hit me with all of your might (Hey)

Black like love too deep
Dance to the soles of my feet
Green eyes envy me
Paint the world pussy pink
Blue like the soul I crowned
Purple drank and couture gowns
Gold fangs a shade God made
Blue, black, white, and brown
Paint the town red like cinnamon
Yellow diamonds, limoncello glycerine
Rainbow gelato in the streets
Renaissance, yachtin' in Capri[Pre-Chorus]

Stay numb and carry on
Too young to hate someone

Your fault if you thought it was
Stay numb and carry on

Truth is, it was never love

Tongue taste like liquid poison
Medicine for my inner voices
Can't drown these static noises, I tried (I tried)
Panic mode, it's Helter Skelter
Red alert, cherry Alka-Seltzer
Shake it up and find some shelter to hide (To hide)
[Pre-Chorus]
I've become emotionless
My heart can't help but wonder where the feeling is[Chorus]
So I just stay numb and carry on

Your fault if you thought it was
Stay numb and carry on
Too young to hate someone
Truth is, it was never love
Your fault if you thought it was
[Verse 2]
I was gin and you were toxic
We have nothin' good in common
Wish we'd just stayed platonic, we tried (We tried)
And my mind gets dark and ominous
Can't change it, that's just how it is
At least I'm bein' honest, no lie (No lie)
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't feel like anyone
The world is mad and they say I'm the crazy one

So I just stay numb and carry on
Too young to hate someone

The song was inspired by the complicated relation between Maroon 5's vocalist, Adam Levine, and his ex-girlfriend, Jane. The song is one of the band's more melodic-sounding songs, with its instantly-recognisable bassline running parallel to the main textured guitar riff. In some versions of the song, including the UK release, the age of the girl in the lyrics is seventeen instead of eighteen.

When the band was commissioned to perform at the AFI Life Achievement Award ceremony for George Lucas, this song was chosen in tribute to Lucas' children, mainly his oldest daughter. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Maroon+5/_/She+Will+Be+Loved"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
One night, a few moons ago
I saw flecks of what could've been lights
But it might just have been you
Passing by unbeknownst to me
Life is emotionally abusive
And time can't stop me quite like you did
And my flight was awful, thanks for asking
I'm unglued, thanks to you
[Chorus: Taylor Swift, 
Taylor Swift & Lana Del Rey
]
And it's like snow at the beach
Weird, but fuckin' beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me
Tonight feels impossible
But it's comin' down
No sound, it's all around

Lana Del Rey

Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow, ah[Verse 2: Taylor Swift,

This scene feels
 like what I once saw 
on a screen
I searched ""aurora borealis
 green""
I've never seen someone 
lit from 
within
Blurring
 out my 
periphery
My smile is 
like I won a contest
And to hide that 
would be so dishonest
And it's fine to 
fake it 'til you make it
'Til 
you
 do, 'ti
l it's true
[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Lana Del Rey]
Now it's like snow at the beach
Weird, but fuckin' beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me
Tonight feels impossible
But it's comin' down
No sound, it's all around

Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow, ah[Bridge: Taylor Swift,

I (I) can't (Can't) speak, afraid to jinx it
I (I) don't (Don't) even dare to wish it
But your eyes are flying saucers from another planet
Now I'm all for you like Janet
Can this be a real thing? 
Can it?
[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Lana Del Rey, 
Taylor Swift

Are we falling like snow at the beach? (
Snow at the beach

Weird, but fuckin' beautiful

Interlude Lyrics
[Verse]
Baby, you've been actin’ so crazy
Like I ain't still your baby
Well, you're a damn fool
It’s like your heart's in this constant eclipse
You can't decide, I don't got time for this, oh, woah
And I tried to keep my cool
And not go too crazy on you
Hear your side and curb my emotions
I won't cry you another ocean
My mind was yours to lose
No lie, that's all I would do
Would you do that shit for me too?
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna call and talk too long
I know it was wrong, but never said I was sorry
Now I've had time to think it over
We're much older and the bone's too big to bury
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, isn't it a shame that it ended like that?
Said goodbye forever, but you never unpacked
We went to Hell, but we never came back
[Chorus]
I'm sorry that you're jaded
I could've taken you places
You're lonely now and I hate it
I'm sorry that you're jaded
[Verse 2]
You're not even willin' to look at your part
You just jump in the car and head down to thе bar 'til you're blurry
Don't know when to stop, so you take it too far
I don't know whеre you are and I'm left in the dark 'til I'm worried
Ooh, and it hurts me
[Pre-Chorus]
And it's a fuckin' shame that it ended like that
You broke your own heart, but you'd never say that
We went to Hell, but we never came back[Chorus]
I'm sorry that you're jaded (Jaded)
I could've taken you places (Places)
You're lonely now and I hate it
I'm sorry that you're jaded
[Bridge]
I won't lie, it won't be easy
When somebody new is on your body
I'll change my number but keep your T-shirt
I don't mind it's torn up and faded
[Chorus]
I'm sorry that you're jaded (Jaded)

​hookup scene Lyrics
[Verse 1]
This hookup scene
Ain't all that it's made out to be
You get your fill and leave empty
More lonely than before
And you lay beside
Somebody you know isn't right
I make-believe it's love, then I
Start lookin' for the door
[Chorus]
If you've got someone to love
And you've almost given up
Hold on tight despite the way they make you mad
'Cause you might not even know that you don't have it so bad
[Verse 2]
A pretty face
It might get you far, but still, it can't replace
The kind of real connection that I crave
The kind we don't have anymore
And I get in my head
Analyzing what I had
It's a chapter that ain't coming back
I coulda learned to love it more[Chorus]
So if you've got someone to love
And you've almost given up
Hold on tight despite the way they make you mad
'Cause you might not even know that you don't have it so bad

Oh
Oh

If you've got someone to love
And you've almost given up
Hold on tight despite the way they make you sad

The theological meaning of limbo is that of a place outside hell and heaven to which unbaptized infants (or in this case, lost people) and the righteous who died before Christ’s coming were traditionally consigned.

The inspiration here derives from ""Dante’s Inferno"" (a book in which Thom's then-partner, Rachel Owen, was a specialist on). Thom has stated in an interview for BBC1 in 2000:

""I just got really into all the aspects of limbo, the levels of hell, and because that’s… It’s quite formative to the way that we all think about heaven and hell and so on, and this song was kicking around at the time and it sounded… Once we’d started recording, it sounded to me… Like some of the voice stuff on it, really just sounds like the voices from limbo, voices that can’t get out.""

For Dante, the Limbo is the first circle of Hell, where he meets great Greek and Latin poets, philosophers and mathematicians, who are there because they were virtuous, but pagans.

It is not necessarily a bad place (Dante describes it as brightly lit and beautiful, but somber), but it is sort of a non-place, somewhere in between spaces. Like the places cited in the first barely recognizable words of the song.

Feeling in limbo, thus, can be a metaphor for writers block or something similar. Perhaps even the sensation of losing one’s sense of ego. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/_/In+Limbo"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

We go fast, we go so fast, we don’t move

Would like to think that you would stick around
You know that I’d just die to make you proud
The taste, the touch, the way we love
It all comes down to make the sound of our love song

Dream a dream, here's a scene
Touch me anywhere ’cause I'm your baby
Grab my waist, don't waste any part
I believe that you see me for who I am
So spill my clothes on the floor of your new car
Is it safe, is it safe to just be who we are?
Is it safe, is it safe to just be who we are?[Chorus]

The first verse describes the thrill of being in the backseat of a car with the person they love, going fast and feeling alive. The singer believes that she can make her partner proud of her and feels like a star when she's with them.

The chorus expresses the singer's desire for a once-in-a-lifetime love and how grateful she is to be in this relationship, despite feeling like a ""fucking mess"". She's thankful for the high life this person has brought her and acknowledges that they've passed some kind of test, but more importantly, she's just happy to be with them.

The second verse is about how the singer feels safe with this person and trusts them to see her for who she really is. They explore each other’s bodies freely and she wonders if it's safe to continue doing so. This verse can be interpreted as the singer poking fun at the concept of safety and how the intensity of their relationship can be both exhilarating and scary.

The final chorus emphasizes that despite any potential risks, the relationship is worth it because of how deeply the two are in love. The ""taste, the touch, the way we love"" all come together to make the sound of their love song. In the end, this is a song about how beautiful and intense it is to be completely in love with someone and the risks and rewards that come with it.

[Verse 1]
Am I the stone in your pocket
That's weighing you down?
Or the face in your locket
That you wear all over town?
I'd be your silver lining
Not a cloud full of rain
And the music would rise up
When I said your name

If this was a movie
I'd be surprised
Hearing your car
Coming up the drive
And you'd run up the stairs
You'd hold my face
Say we're being stupid
And we'd fall back into place
If this was a movie
If this was a movie

If this was a movie
Love would be enough
To save us from the darkness
That's inside both of us
And we'd get away
And we'd be okay[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
The breath of the morning, I keep forgetting
The smell of the warm summer air
I live in a town where you can't smell a thing
You watch your feet for cracks in the pavement
[Verse 2]
And up above aliens hover
Making home movies for the folks back home
Of all these weird creatures who lock up their spirits
Drill holes in themselves and live for their secrets

They're all uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight
Up...

I wish that they'd swoop down in a country lane
Late at night when I'm driving
Take me onboard their beautiful ship
Show me the world as I'd love to see it

They'd think that I've finally lost it completely
I'd show them the stars and the meaning of life

[Verse 1]
Please picture me in the trees
I hit my peak at seven
Feet in the swing over the creek
I was too scared to jump in
But I, I was high in the sky
With Pennsylvania under me
Are there still beautiful things?
[Chorus]
Sweet tea in the summer
Cross your heart, won't tell no other
And though I can’t recall your face
I still got love for you
Your braids like a pattern
Love you to the Moon and to Saturn
Passed down like folk songs
The love lasts so long
[Bridge]
And I've been meaning to tell you
I think your house is haunted
Your dad is always mad and that must be why
And I think you should come live with me
And we can be pirates
Then you won't have to cry
Or hide in the closet
And just like a folk song
Our love will be passed on[Verse 2]
Please picture me in the weeds
Before I learned civility
I used to scream ferociously
Any time I wanted
I, I

Sweet tea in the summer
Cross my heart, won’t tell no other
And though I can't recall your face
I still got love for you

[Verse 1]
I can just hear them now
""How could you let us down?""
But they don't know what I found
Or see it from this way around
Feeling it overtake
All that I used to hate
One by one, every trait
I tried but it's way too late
All the signs I don't read
Two sides of me can't agree
When I breathe in too deep
Going with what I always longed for
[Chorus 1]
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
Well, I don't care I'm in love
(Stop before it's too late)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
I finally know what it's like
(You don't have what it takes)
(Stop before it’s too late)
(I know there's too much at stake)
(Making the same mistakes)
And I still don't know why it's happening
(Stop while it's not too late)
And I still don't know[Verse 2]
Finally taking flight
I know you don't think it's right
I know that you think it's fake
Maybe fake's what I like
Point is I have the right
Not thinking in black and white
I'm thinking it's worth the fight
Soon to be out of sight
Knowing it all this time
Going with what I always longed for
[Chorus 1]
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
I don't care I'm in love
(Stop before it's too late)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
So how do I know that it's right?
(You don't have what it takes)
(Stop before it’s too late)
[Bridge]
And I know that it's hard to digest
But maybe your story ain't so different from the rest
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
And I know that it's hard to digest
A realization is as good as it gets
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets[Chorus 2]
Feel like a brand new person
So, how will I know that it's right?
In a new direction
So, how will I know I've gone too far?
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
I finally know what it's like
(Stop before it's too late)
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
In a new direction
(But you make the same old mistakes)
So how will I know I've gone too far?
(You don't have what it takes)
(Stop before it's too late)
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
And I know it's hard to describe
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
(But you make the same old mistakes)
(You don't have what it takes)

The song was released as the second single from In Rainbows on 31 March 2008. The song was written no later than 1997, when the band began to perform it live. However, a recording of ""Nude"" was not included on any Radiohead album until 10 years later.

The song has undergone numerous revisions since its origins in 1997. It was originally known as ""Big Ideas"", with the parenthetical ""(Don't Get Any)"" often added. Apparently this title was at the suggestion of fans, as the song officially had no title yet, but appeared on some setlists as ""Nude"" or ""Neut"". In the 1998 documentary Meeting People is Easy, singer Thom Yorke joked to journalist Matt Pinfield that the full title was actually supposed to be ""Your Home Is At Risk If You Do Not Keep Up Repayments"". A typical version of the song from this period is heard near the close of that film, in a live performance from Tokyo, with both Thom Yorke and guitarist Jonny Greenwood on keyboards and organ. The song was often performed during the final 1998 leg of the band's tour to promote OK Computer (1997), on which the track did not appear.

After 1998, the band initially planned the track for their next album Kid A (2000), but scrapped efforts to record it; the song did not appear on the band's next two albums, either. During this period, it was performed only rarely, notably on request at a 2002 concert in Salamanca, but usually by Yorke in solo acoustic versions. Band members professed admiration for the song but said they had not figured out the best way to approach it in the studio.

In 2005, the band began new recording sessions with Mark Stent and posted a list of songs they were working on, including the now-officially titled ""Nude"", on their blog, Dead Air Space. This was confirmed in early 2006, when the band revealed that they had been recording ""Nude"" with a string quartet, and that a new string arrangement had been written by Jonny Greenwood. In June 2006, Yorke and Greenwood said in interviews that the song was effectively finished and on tape in a version they were very satisfied with, barring minor adjustments. After their tour, the band returned to the studio in autumn 2006 to continue recording sessions, this time without Stent, but with their longtime producer Nigel Godrich. On the band's summer 2006 tour to introduce their new material, the new version of ""Nude"" was played at nearly every concert. Yet the finished version of the song on In Rainbows differs from any previous version, as although it retains most of its lyrics, it replaces its organ or keyboard-driven state with a dub-influenced bass line and rhythm. The chorus is now picked on electric guitar, and the song features Yorke's vocal of the original Hammond organ melody at the end of the song.

To promote the release of the single, the band began a competition for fans to create their own remixes of the song, from the individual tracks of guitar, drums, bass, vocals and strings. These were made available to download, via iTunes, on April 1, 2008, with all entries available to listen to at the remix website. A music video for the song, featuring all band members in slow motion, was made by comedian Adam Buxton and director Garth Jennings for their ""Scotch Mist"" webcast. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/_/Nude"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Dream of You Lyrics
[Verse 1]
He's a bad dancer, he's the right answer
He's a shy singer most of the time
Unless it's him and I
He's an over-thinker, he's a slow kisser

And you squeeze my hands two times, three times
And believe me, I'll love you always, always

Gonna get that, ooh-ooh

[Skit: Rosie Watson]
Many college students have gone to college and gotten hooked on drugs, marijuana, and alcohol
Listen, stop trying to be somebody else
Don't try to be someone else
Be yourself and know that that's good enough
Don't try to be someone else
Don't try to be like someone else, don't try to act like someone else
Be yourself, be secure with yourself
Rely and trust upon your own decisions
On your own beliefs
You understand the things that I've taught you
Not to drink alcohol, not to use drugs
Don't use that cocaine or marijuana, because that stuff is highly addictive
When people become weed-heads
They become sluggish, lazy, stupid, and unconcerned
Sluggish, lazy, stupid, and unconcerned
That's all marijuana does to you, okay?
 
This is mom
Unless you're taking it under doctor's, um, control
Then it's regulated
Do not smoke marijuana, do not consume alcohol
Do not get in the car with someone who is inebriated
This is mom, call me, bye",https://genius.com/Frank-ocean-be-yourself-lyrics,"“Be Yourself” is a voice message from Rosie Watson, the mother of one of Frank’s childhood friends.

[Part I]
[Pre-Chorus: Justin Vernon]
When I stare in your eyes
You'll be the
re forever
To watch our life
 (
To watch our life together
)
You just like going to Heaven
 (
My heart
)
More than anything
 (
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
)
I'm fallin' and I'm drownin'
But you're takin' me
[Chorus: Travis Scott]
One thousand on my feet, stacks spreaded on my seat
Ten thousand on my eyes (Eyes)
[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Rollie Pollie on my wrist
Gotta make a flight, big day, slummin' no FaceTime
50K, wonderin' why I'm stormin' off, no race
Emboldened by the bliss
I was sworn in by a kiss
Latе from the country caters
No peacеmaker, I sweep up cases
Goin' on a walk with a new suit armor
New suit dead, Bottega, that's on it
Give me the heat from the sleep, then I harm her
Cupid creep in, sleep with a hammer
Three time to get me T-T-T'd
Still same phone, AT&T-T
Still givin' news very vividly
Beefin' up, fuck a beef
Smokin' on some vicious type of reefer
I need no beef, no cheese (Yeah)
Even when I eat, they cheat (Uh)
Every time we meet, naive[Pre-Chorus: Justin Vernon]
When I stare in your eyes
You'll be there forever
To watch our life (To watch our life together)
You just like going to Heav— (My heart)

One thousand on my feet, stacks spreaded on my seat
Ten thousand on my eyes (Eyes)

Yeah, it's mad how it gets so deep
It's mad how I get so high
It's mad how you get me by (By)

It's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me
[Verse: Travis Scott]
Look in my eyes, tell me your tale
Do you see the road, the map to my soul?
Look, tell me the signs whenever the smoke clear out of my face
Am I picture-perfect or do I look fried?
All of that green and yellow, that drip from your eyes is tellin'
Tell you demise, I went to my side
To push back the ceilin' and push back the feelings, I had to decide
I replay them nights, and right by my side, all I see is a city of people that ride wit' me
If they just knew what Scotty would do to jump off the stage and save him a child
The things I created became the most weighted, I gotta find balance and keep me a smile (Hah)
Yeah, yeah
That shit wild, instead I'm a hero
I took it from zero, LaFlame Usain
I run it for miles, this shit wasn't luck
They got me fucked up, I put you on bus and take you around
A couple of guys inside of the school, I gave 'em the tools to get it off ground
They say they the ones when they make the errors
Can't look in the mirror (That shit wild)
I stand on the stage, I give 'em the rage
No turnin' it down, can't tame it, can't follow it
We do in the streets, we do it for keeps
We do it for rights, got fifty-two weeks
This shit ain't for pleasure, I'm comin' to tweak
This shit is forever and infinity
Number eight, yeah, we write it and wrap it around
I take me a bean and I turn to a beast
Bought the crib on a hill, made it harder to reach
Bought a couple more whips 'cause I needed more speed
Bought a couple more watches, I needed more time
Didn't buy the condo, it was smarter to lease
And I bought some more ice 'cause I brought in the heat
Made a cast of my dick, so she never gon' cheat
If I gave you a day in my life or a day in my eyes, don't blink",https://genius.com/Travis-scott-my-eyes-lyrics,"“MY EYES” portrays Travis Scott’s life throughout his POV as he raps about the struggles and obstacles he’s gone through in his life.

However, in the second part of the track, Travis flips the warm, somber rhythm to a faster trap cadence in which it could be perceived that he’s bragging, however, behind that, Travis speaks about his personal view of life, particularly noting that he desires his childhood more than ever.

Surprisingly, Travis references the ASTROWORLD Festival crowd crush in the lines, ""I replay them nights, and right by my side, all I see is a city of people that ride wit' me.

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
This feelin' is unmatched
This feelin' is brought to you by adrenaline and good rap
Black Pendleton ball cap (West, west, west)
We don't share the same synonym, fall back (West, west, west)
Been in it before internet had new acts
Mimicking radio's nemesis made me wack (Ooh-ooh)
My innocence limited, the experience lacked
Ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked
The mind of a literate writer, but I did it, in fact (Yeah)
You admitted it once I submitted it, wrapped in plastic
Remember scribblin', scratchin' diligent sentences backwards
Visiting freestyle cyphers for your reaction
Now, I can live in a stadium, pack it the fastest
Gamblin' Benjamin benefits, sinnin' in traffic
Spinnin' women in cartwheels, linen fabric on fashion
Winnin' in every decision, Kendrick is master that mastered it
Isn't it lovely how menaces turned attraction?
Pivotin' rappers, finish your fraction while writing blue magic
Thank God for rap
I would say it got me a plaque, but what's better than that?
The fact it brought me back home[Chorus: Lalah Hathway & Taz Arnold]
We been waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
Waitin' for you

I know everything
I know everything,
 know myself
I know morality, spirituality, good and bad health
I know fatality might haunt you
I know everything
I know Compton, I know street shit,
I know shit that's conscious
I know everything, I know lawyers, advertisement and sponsors
I know wisdom, I know bad religion, I know good karma
I know everything, I know history
I know the universe works mentally
I know the perks of bullshit isn't meant for me
I know everything, I know cars, clothes, hoes, and money
I know loyalty, I know respect, I know those that's ornery
I know everything, the highs, the lows, the groupies, the junkies
I know if I'm generous at heart, I don't need recognition
The way I'm rewarded—well, that's God's decision
I know you know that line's for Compton School District
Just give it to the kids, don’t gossip 'bout how it was distributed
I know how people work
I know the price of life, I'm knowin' how much it’s worth
I know what I know, and I know it well not to ever forget
Until I realized I didn’t know shit, the day I came home[Chorus: Lalah Hathway & Taz Arnold]
We been waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I met a little boy that resembled my features
Nappy afro, gap in his smile, hand-me-down sneakers
Bounced through the crowd
Run a number on man and woman that crossed him
Sun beamin' on his beady beads, exhausted
Tossin' footballs with his ashy, black ankles
Breakin' new laws, mama passed on home trainin'
He looked at me and said, ""Kendrick, you do know my language
You just forgot because of what public schools had painted""
Oh, I forgot, ""Don't Kill My Vibe,"" that's right, you're famous
I used to watch on Channel 5, TV was taken
But never mind, you're here right now, don't you mistake it
It's just a new trip, take a glimpse of your family ancestor
Make a new list of everything you thought was progress
And that was bullshit, I know your life is full of turmoil
Spoiled by fantasies of who you are, I feel bad for you
I can attempt to enlighten you without frightenin' you
If you resist, I'll back off quick, go catch a flight or two
But if you pick destiny over rest-in-peace
Then be an advocate, tell your homies, especially
To come back home""[Part II]
[Interlude]
This is a world premiere (This is a world premiere)
This is a world premiere (This is a world premiere)
This is a world premiere
[Refrain: Kendrick Lamar]
I been lookin' for you my whole life, an appetite
For the feeling I can barely describe, where you reside?
Is it in a woman, is it in money or mankind?
I been lookin' for you my whole life, an appetite
For the feeling I can barely describe, where you reside?
Is it in a woman, is it in money, or mankind?
Tell me something, think I'm losing my mind, ah!
[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
I say, where you at? From the front to the back
I'm lookin' for you, I react only when you react
Ah, I thought I found you, back in the ghetto
When I was seventeen with the .38 special
Maybe you're in a dollar bill, maybe you're not real
Maybe only the wealthy get to know how you feel
Maybe I'm paranoid, ha, maybe I don't need you anyway
Don't lie to me, I'm suicidal anyway
I can be your advocate
I can preach for you if you tell me what the matter is",https://genius.com/Kendrick-lamar-momma-lyrics,"""Momma"" contains elements of ""On Your Own"", written and performed by Lalah Hathaway, along with ""Computer Love"", written and performed by Zapp and Roger, as well as additional vocals performed by Lalah Hathaway and Bilal. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Kendrick+Lamar/_/Momma"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","""Momma"" contains elements of ""On Your Own"", written and performed by Lalah Hathaway, along with ""Computer Love"", written and performed by Zapp and Roger, as well as additional vocals performed by Lalah Hathaway and Bilal. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Kendrick+Lamar/_/Momma"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

[Verse 1]
You were riding your bike to the sound of ""It's No Big Deal""
And you're trying to lift off the ground on those old two wheels
Nothing 'bout the way that you were treated ever seemed especially alarming till now
So you tie up your hair and you smile like it's no big deal
[Chorus]
You can let it go
You can throw a party full of everyone you know
And not invite your family 'cause they never showed you love
You don't have to be sorry for leavin' and growin' up, mmm
[Verse 2]
Matilda
, you talk of the pain like it's all alright
But I know that you feel like a piece of you's dead insidе
You showed me a power that is strong еnough to bring sun to the darkest days
It's none of my business, but it's just been on my mind
[Chorus]
You can let it go
You can throw a party full of everyone you know
And not invite your family 'cause they never showed you love
You don't have to be sorry for leavin' and growin' up
You can see the world, following the seasons
Anywhere you go, you don't need a reason
'Cause they never showed you love
You don't have to be sorry for doin' it on your own[Bridge]
You're just in time, make your tea and your toast
You framed all your posters and dyed your clothes, ooh
You don't have to go
You don't have to go home
Oh, there's a long way to go
I don't believe that time will change your mind
In other words, I know they won't hurt you anymore
As long as you can let them go
[Chorus]
You can let it go
You can throw a party full of everyone you know
You can start a family who will always show you love
You don't have to be sorry for doin' it on your own

Though Roald Dahl’s character Matilda is gendered as female, Styles purposefully does not assign a label to the person he sings to. The song asserts a common theme in the album that home is not a place, but a state of mind. Styles does this by showing how Matilda’s house was not a home to her.

""I had an experience with someone where, in getting to know them better, they revealed some stuff to me that was very much like, ‘Oh, that’s not normal, like I think you should maybe get some help or something.’ This song was inspired by that experience and person, who I kind of disguised as Matilda from the Roald Dahl book. I played it to a couple of friends and all of them cried. So I was like, ‘Okay, I think this is something to pay attention to.’ It’s a weird one, because with something like this, it’s like, ‘I want to give you something, I want to support you in some way, but it’s not necessarily my place to make it about me because it’s not my experience.’ Sometimes it’s just about listening. I hope that’s what I did here. If nothing else, it just says, ‘I was listening to you.’""

""I think “Matilda” is kind of self-explanatory […] I like that it was this personal story to me about someone else, being able to say, “This thing is more important than me just making music about myself, because I think it could mean more to you and a lot more people” […] I played it for a couple of friends, and all of them cried. I was, like, “Okay, this is something to pay attention to.” But I haven’t played it to the person who it’s about, and they don’t know it’s about them.""

Bad time for a good time, baby, a bad time

You never finish your glass, take a little sip and you're bored
Down in the apartment below, wouldn't even open your door

And every time is probably gonna be a bad time
Sorry, but it's not like the last time
When you were callin' me and hopin' for a good time
Bad time for a good time, baby, a bad time
You should know about it by now
Bad time for a good time, baby, a bad time

Let's talk about it, talk about it, yeah

[Intro: Adam Levine]
I'm at a payphone, tryin' to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down
[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

I would still be holdin' you like this
All those fairytales are full of shit
One more fuckin' love song, I'll be sick, oh[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
You turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine (Oh)
I don't expect you to care (Yeah)
I know I said it before, but
All of our bridges burned down
[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed (Oh)

Man, fuck that shit
I be out spendin' all this money while you sittin' 'round
Wonderin' why it wasn't you who came up from nothin'
Made it from the bottom, now when you see me, I'm stuntin'
And all of my cars start with the push of a button
Tellin' me I changed since I blew up or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone so you never could call it
Don't need my name on my shirt, you can tell that I'm ballin'
Swish, what a shame, coulda got picked
Had a really good game, but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you coulda saw, but sad to say it's over for
Phantom pulled up, valet open doors
Wished I'd go away, got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want
So you can go and take that little piece of shit with you

The opening lines already establish the theme as Gaga sings ""My name isn't Alice, but I'll keep looking for Wonderland"", implying that she wants to escape to a place where she can be the best version of herself. The chorus repeats this sentiment, expressing the idea that although she is not Alice, she is still searching for her own version of Wonderland.

The second verse suggests that Gaga is tired of trying to break free on her own and wants someone to lift her from her struggles. She mentions being ""sick and tired"" of her reality and screams out for someone to help free her from her mind and the pain it brings.

The post-chorus repetition of ""take me home, take me to Wonderland"" reinforces the theme of finding a place of safety and happiness away from the difficulties of life.

Overall, the song is a plea for hope and a happier reality, and a search for meaning beyond the troubles that Gaga faces. It speaks to the desire to find a place where one can be free and escape the pressures of society and the struggles in life. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Lady+Gaga/_/Alice"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Although the studio version was never released as a single, the song is a fan favorite and a staple on classic rock radio stations.

When explaining his lyrical inspiration for the song, lead singer and then-songwriter Brian Johnson recalled reading a British article about a neighborhood pusher who made daily rounds (almost like a milkman) throughout the London suburbs, selling narcotics to bored, lonely and depressed housewives. These substance-effected homemakers would then peruse the local clubs and bars, seeking out torrid, extra-marital relationships. The term ""shoot to thrill"" most likely refers to certain solutions such as diazepam (valium), which is often administered via injection to treat anxiety and depression.

Lead guitarist Angus Young has recently commented that the song's ""breakdown"", which occurs soon after the main solo (a muted and repeating three chord sequence of A Major triad, G Major triad, and a D power-chord leading up to a bombastic outro-solo), was inspired by the trio gun-battle climax from Sergio Leone's classic, Italian western The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. In this seminal scene, gun-fighters Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Eli Wallach stare one another down in the center of a Civil-War cemetery for minutes-on-end to an eventual shoot-out. Young said this sequence in the song was designed to mirror the actual soundtrack selection ""Il Triello"" by composer Ennio Morricone. Both compositions feature a slow quiet build-up, increasing in tension to a thunderous, cataclysmic finale. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/AC%2FDC/_/Shoot+to+Thrill"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Walking around like you God's gift to Earth, nigga, you ain't shit
You ain't even buy me no outfit for the Fourth
I need that Brazilian, wavy, twenty-eight inch, you playin'
I shouldn't be fuckin' with you anyway
I need a baller-ass, boss-ass nigga
You's a off-brand-ass nigga, everybody know it
Your homies know it, everybody fuckin' know

You won't know, you gonna lose on a good bitch
My other nigga is on, you off
What the fuck is really going on?

This dick ain't free
You lookin' at me like it ain't a receipt
Like I never made ends meet
Eating your leftovers and raw meat
This dick ain't free
Livin' in captivity raised my cap salary
Celery, tellin' me green is all I need
Evidently, all I seen was Spam and raw sardines
This dick ain't free,
 
I mean, baby
You really think we could make a baby named Mercedes
Without a Mercedes Benz and twenty-four-inch rims
Five percent tint, and air conditioning vents?
Hell fuckin' naw,

Not a forty ounce and a pitbull

Had the door knockin', let 'em in, who's that?

this dick ain't free
Pity the fool that made the pretty in you prosper
Titty juice and pussy lips kept me obnoxious
Kept me up watchin' pornos in poverty; apology? No
Watch you politic with people less fortunate, like myself
Every dog has its day, now doggy style shall help
This dick ain't free
Matter of fact, it need interest
Matter of fact, it's nine inches
Matter of fact, see our friendship based on business
Pension, more pension, you're pinchin' my percents
It's been relentless, fuck forgiveness, fuck your feelings
Fuck your sources, all distortion, if you fuck it's more abortion
More divorce courts and portion
My check with less endorsement left me dormant
Dusted, doomed, disgusted, forced with
Fuck you think is in more shit?
Porcelain pipes pressure, bust 'em twice

In a jackknifed juggernaut

In the neon sign
Scrolling up and down

According to Thom, the song itself is about the ""feeling you get when you realise that you've just missed having a serious accident"", and the ""feeling of elation that follows"". The song is one of Thom's favourites off OK Computer. The song takes inspiration from DJ Shadow's use of cut up drum beats to create the unique drum sound. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/_/Airbag"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time, the planets and the fates
And all the stars aligned
You and I ended up in the same room
At the same time
[Pre-Chorus]
And the touch of a hand lit the fuse
Of a chain reaction of countermoves
To assess the equation of you
Checkmate, I couldn't lose
[Chorus]
What if I told you none of it was accidental?
And the first night that you saw me
Nothing was gonna stop me
I laid the groundwork, and then
Just like clockwork
The dominoes cascaded in a line
What if I told you I'm a mastermind?
And now you're mine
It was all by dеsign
'Cause I'm a mastermind
[Verse 2]
You see, all the wisеst women
Had to do it this way
'Cause we were born to be the pawn
In every lover's game[Pre-Chorus]
If you fail to plan, you plan to fail
Strategy sets the scene for the tale
I'm the wind in our free-flowing sails
And the liquor in our cocktails
[Chorus]
What if I told you none of it was accidental?
And the first night that you saw me
I knew I wanted your body
I laid the groundwork, and then
Just like clockwork
The dominoes cascaded in a line
What if I told you I'm a mastermind?
And now you're mine
It was all my design
'Cause I'm a mastermind
[Bridge]
No one wanted to play with me as a little kid
So I've been scheming like a criminal ever since
To make them love me and make it seem effortless
This is the first time I've felt the need to confess
And I swear
I'm only cryptic and Machiavellian
'Cause I care[Chorus]
So I told you none of it was accidental
And the first night that you saw me
Nothing was gonna stop me
I laid the groundwork, and then
Saw a wide smirk on your face
You knew the entire time
You knew that I'm a mastermind
And now you're mine
Yeah, all you did was smile

The title is also a nod to her fans calling Swift a “mastermind” for her careful planning of Easter eggs and releases.

Taylor unveiled the “Mastermind” title in a TikTok video where she drew a random ping pong ball from a bingo machine.

[Verse 1]
John met me down on the boulevard
Cry on his shoulder 'cause life is hard
The waves came in over my head
What you been up to, my baby?
Haven't seen you 'round here lately
All of the guys tell me lies, but you don't
You just crack another beer
And pretend that you're still here
[Chorus]
This is how to disappear
This is how to disappear
[Verse 2]
Joe met me down at the training yard
Cuts on his face 'cause he fought too hard
I know he's in over his head
But I love that man like nobody can
He moves mountains and pounds them to ground again
I watched the guys getting high as they fight
For the things that they hold dear
To forget the things they fear
[Chorus]
This is how to disappear
This is how to disappear[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Now it's been years since I left New York
I've got a kid and two cats in the yard
The California sun and the movie stars
I watch the skies getting light as I write
As I think about those years
As I whisper in your ear

The lyrics discuss the narrator's yearning for a past love, while she is surrounded by the comforts of the world around her including the ""California sun and the movie stars"". At the same time, the narrator notes that she is still here, and she will be right here– suggesting that she is at peace with her past and is no longer trying to escape it. The chorus, ""this is how to disappear"", can be interpreted as learning how to let go, and no longer be defined by the past. The song implies that, in learning to disappear from the past and move forward, the narrator can find peace, love and solace.

Big Ego’s Lyrics
Big Ego’s appears as track 5 on Dr. Dre’s 2001. The song features Hittman on the second verse.

Lyrics for Dr. Dre’s verse were written by The D.O.C., hook and 2nd verse written and performed by Hittman.
[Spoken Intro]
Los Angeles Approach Control
This is Cessna 0281-Echo-119.3, over
Cessna 81-Echo, Los Angeles Approach Control, roger, go ahead
Cessna 81-Echo is over the Compton Airport, 5-2 at 5000
Requesting ground controlled approach
To the Los Angeles Airport, over
81-Echo, Los Angeles approach controlled, roger
Radar identification; turn right, heading
0-3-0
[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
I got mo' class than most of 'em, ran with the best of 'em
Forgave the less of 'em and blazed at the rest of 'em
What can I say? Cali-for-ni-a
Where niggas die every day over some shit they say
Disconnected from the streets forever
As long as I got a Beretta, nigga, I'm down for whateva
I roll with my shit off safety, for niggas that been hatin' me lately
And the bitches that wanna break me
If Cali blew up, I'd be in the Aftermath
Bumpin' gangsta rap shit, down to blast for cash
'Cause from Eazy-E, to D.O.C., to DPG
Started from that S.O.B., D-R-E
Like Dub-C, I'm rich rollin', pistol holdin'
Pockets swole, nigga, that's how I'm rollin'
Put the flame to the killer, nigga
Worldwide homicide mob figure in the building, for real
I'm hittin' switches, makin' bitches eat bitches
See me grab my dick every time I pose for pictures
I own acres, floor seats watchin' the Lakers
I'm cool with éses who got AK's in cases[Chorus: Hittman]
Dedicated to all of those with big egos
Never fakin', we get the dough and live legal
Haters hate this, we sip the Mo' and yank the Heezos
Niggas play this in their Rovers, Jeeps, and Regals
Dedicated to all of those with big egos
Never fakin', we get the dough and live legal
Haters hate this, we sip the Mo' and yank the Heezos
Bitches play this in their Benzes, Jeeps, and Geos
[Verse 2: Hittman]
I'll bust a Mr. Toughy, slash a Smoovy Doovy
Crashin' Flex on Tuesdays, harassin' hoes at movies
Passin' by with Uzis, like who you aiming at?
That shady bitch and that bitch nigga that was claimin' that
Rat-a-tat-tat
[Automatic gunfire, screaming, followed by tires peeling]
I don't sympathize for wack hoes and wimpy guys
You gotta recognize Hittman is an enterprise
Cali pride, Bronson rider, South Central-ised
The Henny got me energized, smoke the guys
Tryna focus on mines, poke they eyes out, I'm L.A.'s loc'est
Hope they don't have to find out the hard way
Like snitch niggas in the pen that get hit when the guards look the other way
We hittin' hard – Hittman and Dre
You playin' games? I suggest you know the rules
We puttin' guns to fools, make you run yo' jewels
Take yo' honey and cruise to the Snooty and snooze
Cop booze, pop coochie 'til the nut oozes
You shouldn't fuck with crews this sick
The Aftermath is we rule shit
I'm Big Hitt, don't confuse me with no other
'Bout to blow, motherfucker[Chorus: Hittman]
Dedicated to all of those with big egos
Never fakin', we get the dough and live legal
Haters hate this, we sip the Mo' and yank the Heezos
Niggas play this in their Rovers, Jeeps, and Regals
Dedicated to all of those with big egos
Never fakin', we get the dough and live legal
Haters hate this, we sip the Mo' and yank the Heezos
Bitches play this in their Benzes, Jeeps, and Geos
[Outro: Hittman]
You look like A.C. Green, bitch, don't call here anymore
With feet like Ben Vereen's, bitch, don't call here anymore
No no, no no
What up? It's Hittman
I ain't at the crib right now
So you can leave your name and number after the beep
Unless it's Tammie's ugly ass – I ain't fuckin' with you",https://genius.com/Dr-dre-big-egos-lyrics,"",""

[Verse 1]
Cinnamon in my teeth
From your kiss, you're touching me
All the pills that you take
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me at arm's length don't work
You try to push me out, but I just find my way back in
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me out, I win
[Chorus]
There's things I wanna say to you
But I'll just let you live
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
There's things I wanna talk about
But better not to give
But if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

Kerosene in my hands
You make me mad, on fire again
All the pills that you take
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me at arm's length don't work

There's things I wanna say to you
But I'll just let you live
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
There's things I wanna talk about
But better not to give
But if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, honey
Be the first who ever did
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, honey
Be the first who ever did

There's things I wanna say to you
But I'll just let you live

​simple times Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Every day felt like Friday
Walking to the 7-Eleven
Me and all of my best friends
We were always together
I remember talking on the phone all night
Didn't know it was a simple time
[Chorus]
Wish that I could put this game on pause
Skip this round, take the headset off
Put my lip gloss on
Kick it at the mall like there's nothin' wrong
I need to step away
If I don't, I'm gonna go insane 'cause
Being grown up kind of sucks and I'm
Really just missing the simple times, uh-huh
[Verse 2]
I think I'm going off of the deep end
I wanna wake up on an island
Throw еverybody a peace sign
Put all thе static on silent
We could stay up all night
Pour one out for the simple times[Chorus]
Wish that I could put this game on pause
Skip this round, take the headset off
Put my lip gloss on
Kick it at the mall like there's nothin' wrong
I need to step away
And if I don't, I'm gonna go insane 'cause
Being grown up kind of sucks and I'm
Really just missing the simple times, uh-huh
[Bridge]
There's nothing really going on
But I heard about a rager
I won't be waiting by the phone
So you can hit me on the pager
[Chorus]
Wish that I could put this game on pause
Skip this round, take the headset off
Put my high-tops on
Kick it at the mall like there's nothin' wrong
I need to step away
If I don't, I'm gonna go insane 'cause

LOGO (English Ver.) Lyrics
[Verse 1: Yonghoon]
Live in the night
After a long time goes by
I think I know now
That guitar covered in dust
I'll trade it, yeah
There's no refund, there's the dice thrown
Shot in the dark
I'm betting everything on you now
[Pre-Chorus: Dongmyeong, 
Yonghoon
]
Even if no one else wants to see this dark night
Even if it is still taking a long time
I want to hear your voice, even though it's not sweet
I'll sing for you as long as you're here forever
So that my voice can touch the sky
[Chorus: Yonghoon]
The time my heart meets with your heart
Ooh, ooh-ooh
So that my voice can touch thе sky
[Verse 2: CyA]
(Yah-ah-ah)
Was up all night, eyes didn't close, drama (Yеah-ah)
Hurry, spotlight, shine it, get it out, trauma
Open your arms to me and be my lighthouse
Freely, the most beautifully, the brand, be yours
It's not bad (Bad, bad)
Getting to you, mm-mm-mm-mm-mm (Mm-mm, mm-mm)
Let's spread your logo worldwide, don't forgo (We gonna go)
Play nonstop for all, let's go[Pre-Chorus: Yonghoon, Dongmyeong]
Endless flowing time pushes me far away
Sometimes, I feel afraid, keep hidin' away
I want to hear your voice, even though you care less
I'll sing for you as long as you're here forever
So that my voice can touch the sky
[Chorus: Dongmyeong, 
Yonghoon
]
The time my heart meets with your heart
Ooh, ooh-ooh
So that my voice can touch the sky
[Bridge: Yonghoon]
Even if the countless stars
Strive out to shine out bright
They are shining to the full
Although I am under the countless stars
So that I can be myself
So that you find me always
I'll never fade away
I'll never fade away, oh

The time my heart meets with your heart
Ooh, ooh-ooh
So that my voice can touch the sky[Outro: Yonghoon]

Sweet Nothing Lyrics
“Sweet Nothing,” the 12th track on Swift’s Midnights album, is a slow, soft love song which seems to reflect the concept of soft words exchanged between lovers that are often called “sweet nothings.”

[Verse 1]
I spy with my little tired eye
Tiny as a firefly
A pebble that we picked up last July
Down deep inside your pocket
We almost forgot it
Does it ever miss Wicklow sometimes?
Ooh, ooh
[Chorus]
They said the end is comin'
Everyone’s up to somethin'
I find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings
Outside, they’re push and shovin'
You're in the kitchen hummin'
All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin'

On the way home
I wrote a poem
You say, ""What a mind""
This happens all the time
Ooh, ooh

I find myself runnin’ home to your sweet nothings
Outside, they're push and shovin’
You're in the kitchen hummin'
All that you ever wanted from me was nothin'[Bridge]
Industry disruptors and soul deconstructors
And smooth-talking hucksters out glad-handing each other
And the voices that implore, ""You should be doing more""
To you, I can admit that I’m just too soft for all of it
Ooh
[Chorus]
They said the end is comin'
Everyone's up to somethin'
I find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings
Outside, they're push and shovin'
You're in the kitchen hummin'
All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin'
They said the end is comin' (They said the end is comin')
Everyone's up to somethin' (Everyone's up to somethin')
I find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings

[Intro: Doug Middlebrook]
Here's the thing: you’re in love with a version of a person that you've created in your head, that you are trying to but cannot fix. Uh, the only person you can fix is yourself. I love you, this has gone on way too long. Enough is enough. I'm two blocks away, I’m coming over.​
[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
Painted a picture, I thought I knew you well
I got a habit of seeing what isn't there
Caught in the moment, tangled up in your sheets
When you broke my heart, I said you only wanted half of me
[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
My imagination's too creative
They see demon, I see angel, angel (Angel), angel
Without the halo, wingless angel
[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Falling, falling, but I never thought you'd leave me
Falling, falling, needed something to believe in, oh
I thought you were the one
But it was all in my head
It was all in my head (Skrrt, skrrt)
[Post-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Yeah, look at you (You), boy, I invented you
Your Gucci tennis shoes, runnin' from your issues
Cardio good for the heart (For the heart)
I figured we could work it out, hmm[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
Painted a picture; I thought I drew you well
I had a vision, seeing what isn't there
Caught in the moment, tangled up in your sheets
When you broke my heart, said you only wanted half of me
[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
My imagination's too creative
They see Cain and I see Abel (Abel), Abel (Abel), Abel
I know you're able, willin’ and able
[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Falling, falling, boy, I thought that you would need me
Falling, falling, needed something to believe in, oh
I thought you were the one
But it was all in my head
It was all in my head (Skrrt, skrrt)

Yeah, look at you (You), boy, I invented you
Your Gucci tennis shoes, runnin’ from your issues
Cardio good for the heart (For the heart)

[Bridge: Ariana Grande]
Wanted you to grow, but, boy, you wasn't budding
Everything you are made you everything you aren’t
I saw your potential without seein' credentials
Maybe that's the issue (Damn, damn)
Said maybe that's the issue, ah
Can’t hold that shit against you, ah
Guess I did it to myself, yeah

An unannounced music video for ""in my head"", directed by Bardia Zeinali, was released on July 9, 2019. It was produced by the team at Vogue, who interviewed and featured Grande on their cover for the August 2019 issue. It depicts the singer with her signature style as she dances and performs the track in a bright white room that represents her own mind. It received positive reviews from critics, who noted its minimalist style and compared it with clips released in the late 1990s.

[Intro]
Ooh, and I can feel you
Even though I haven't touched you
Yeah, that's what love is
That's what true love is
Wouldn't want nobody else by my side
Ooh, and you can trust me
After all the lies I told you
Yeah, that's what love is
That's what true love is
Don't nobody else deserve my time
[Verse 1]
I reach out to you, but my hands can't hold enough
Enough of your greatness
You teach me patience
Like the best of our worlds collide
Never understood what it meant
It meant to submit to love
So beyond what lust is
Hey, it's a blessing that you're in my life
Make me look even better
When we shine, we shine together
[Chorus]
Yeah, that's what love is
Now, that's what love is
Don't nobody else deserve my eyes[Verse 2]
When you demand my presence, it's hard to read the message
I stay on the defense to take away your leverage
'Til you put it in perspective
Can't help but to respect it
Oh, now I know what love is
I know what true love is
Yeah, down in my soul
Far more than you know
My self-esteem gets low
You lift it right up through the ceiling, woah
[Chorus]
Ooh, and I can feel you
Even though I haven't touched you
Yeah, that's what love is
Now, that's what love is
Wouldn't want nobody else by my side, no

(Oh-oh-oh, oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh)
That's what love is (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh)
That's what love is (La-la-la, la, la, la)
I appreciate you (Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh)
God bless your maker, hey-hey (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh)
That's what love is (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh)
That's what love is (La-la-la, la, la, la)

“That’s What Love Is” features nothing but an acoustic guitar, capo’d high and twinkling like a music box. The words redefine “sweet nothings” (“Don’t nobody else deserve my eyes,” he avows) but they dissolve in the sunlight of Bieber’s falsetto. The way he capers between chest and head voice is effortless and dazzling, like watching a figure skater land triple lutzes, one after the other.

Back Down Lyrics
In “Back Down,” 50 Cent takes a blatant break from rapping about the dangers of life for a gangster and decides to direct his attention to addressing fellow New York City rapper, Ja Rule, who he was beefing…

[Intro]
Woo
Yeah
G-G-G-G-G-Unit (
G-Unit
)
Haha
[Chorus]
It's easy to see when you look at me
If you look closely, 50 don't back down
Everywhere I go, both coasts with toast
East side, west side, I hold that MAC down
Every little nigga you see around me
Hold a gun big enough to fucking hold Shaq down
Next time you in the hood and see a OG
You ask about me, the young boy don't back down
[Verse 1]
Any living thing that cannot co-exist with the kid
Must decease existin', little nigga, now listen (Yeah)
Your mammy, your pappy, that bitch you chasin'
Your little dirty-ass kids, I'll fucking erase 'em
Your success is not enough, you wanna be hard (Yeah)
Knowing that if you get knocked, you get fucked in the yard (Ah)
You's a Pop Tart, sweetheart, you soft in the middle (Haha)
I eat you for breakfast,
 
the watch was an exchange for your necklace
And your boss is a bitch, if he could he would
Sell his soul for cheap, trade his life to be Suge
You can buy cars, but can't buy respect in 
the hood
Maybe I'm so disrespectful 'cause to me you're a mystery
I know niggas from your hood, you have no history (Uh-huh)
Never poked nothing, never popped nothing, nigga stop fronting
Jay put you on, X made you hot
Now you run around like you some big shot, haha (Haha), pussy[Chorus]
It's easy to see when you look at me
If you look closely, 50 don't back down
Everywhere I go, both coasts with toast
East side, west side, I hold that MAC down
Every little nigga you see around me
Hold a gun big enough to fucking hold Shaq down
Next time you in the hood and see a OG
You ask about me, the young boy don't back down
[Verse 2]
""The rap game is all fucked up now, what are we gonna do now?
How we gonna eat man? 50 back around""
That's Ja little punk ass thinking out loud
South side 'til I die, that's just how I get down
I'm back in the game, shawty, to rule and conquer
You sing for hoes and sound like the Cookie Monster
I'm the hardest from New York, my flow is bonkers
All the other hard niggas, they come from Yonkers
It's been years and you had the same niggas in the background
You're never gonna sell Mitsubishi Tah or Crack Child
Them niggas there just suck, they no good
I ain't never heard a nigga say they like them in the hood
I'm back, better than ever, on top of my game
Even them country boys saying, ""50 we feeling you, mane""
Now y'all stay the fuck outta my zone, outta my throne
I'm New York City's own bad guy (Bad guy)[Chorus]
It's easy to see when you look at me
If you look closely, 50 don't back down
Everywhere I go, both coasts with toast
East side, west side, I hold that MAC down
Every little nigga you see around me
Hold a gun big enough to fucking hold Shaq down
Next time you in the hood and see a OG
You ask about me, the young boy don't back down
[Verse 3]
I ain't gon' tell nobody you pussy
I ain't gon' tell nobody you getting extorted
 (Nah, it ain't over, 
G-Unit
)
I've been patiently waiting to blow
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to ""The 50 Cent Show""
This is my life, my pain, my knife, my gun
Now that I'm back, you can't sleep, I'm a nightmare, huh?
You hired cops to hold you down 'cause you fear for your life
But you done heard about them guns I done bought, right?
I ain't going nowhere, I done told you, nigga
I'm a G-Unit motherfuckin' soldier, nigga

They not gon' like you
)
I know, I know, haha (
G-Unit
)
[Outro: Alex Thomas]
Oh no, he didn't say anything about Ja, okay?
Ja is my boo, okay? Jeffrey Atkins ain't never hurt nobody
And y'all know big thangs come in small packages, holla
Now everythang was cool until 50 Cent came back into the picture
They better not put they hands on Jeffrey, okay?
'Cause first of all, they do not know that I am a twelve degree pink belt, okay?
I will dice his ass up like a little piece of celery, okay?
'Cause, see, they don't know me, Delicious
Do they know me? Okay, I thought so

And I will Jet Li his ass, wa-ta!",https://genius.com/50-cent-back-down-lyrics,"“Back Down” finds 50 Cent setting off an attack aimed at Ja Rule, who apparently wants to contend with him, hence their beef. 50 cent refers to himself as ‘The Kid’, and refers to Ja Rule as ‘little ni**a’, suggesting their status differences in the rap game.

He warns Ja about messing with him by stating that if he insists on getting in his way, he will attack all the people around him, including his parents, wife and kids. 50 Cent’s major problem with Ja Rule is that he is trying to portray himself as a tough gangster instead of focusing on his rap career. The rapper’s response to this is that Ja is nothing compared to him and despite his tough outlook, he is nothing but a softie who will not last if faced with the hardships that come with gangster living.

50 Cent further raps about how Ja Rule isn’t worth his attention and can easily be intimidated by the weapons he and his crew wield. He implies that Ja unlike him, does not have any records in the street, cannot survive in prison thus should quit pretending and competing with people like him whose career has been built from real life experiences.

No Promises Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Staring out my hotel window
Too much on my mind
Maybe we should keep it simple
We don't have to decide
[Pre-Chorus]

'Cause I've been here once before, don't even say It

So, baby, please, baby, please, no promises

So tell me what you want
Take my hands across your body
We don't have to hold on

And I don't wanna let it slip away
I've been living only for this moment
And I don't know how much that I can take, yeah

Niggas heard I fuck with Dre, now they wanna show me love
When you sell like Eminem, then the hoes, they wanna fuck (Woo)
Look homie, ain't nothin' changed, hoes down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the cut, hey, nigga, roll that weed up (Roll that)
If you watch how I move, you'll mistake me for a player or pimp
Been hit with a few shells, but I don't walk with a limp (I'm aight)
In the hood in L.A., they sayin', ""50, you hot"" (Uh-huh)
They like me, I want 'em to love me like they love Pac
But holla in New York, the niggas'll tell you I'm loco (Yeah)
And the plan is to put the rap game in a chokehold (Uh-huh)
I'm fully focused, man, my money on my mind
Got a mil' out the deal and I'm still on the grind (Woo)

Her girlfriend with her, they bi and they ready to go (Okay)[Chorus]

My flow, my show brought me the dough
That bought me all my fancy things
My crib, my cars, my clothes, my jewels
Look, nigga, I done came up and I ain't changed (What? What? Yeah)
[Verse 2]
And you should love it way more than you hate it
Nigga, you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it (Woo)
I'm that cat by the bar toastin' to the good life
You that faggot-ass nigga tryna pull me back, right?
When my joint get to bumpin' in the club, it's on
I wink my eye at your bitch, if she smiles, she gone
If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
If you talkin' about money, homie, I ain't concerned
I'ma tell you what Banks told me, ""Cuz, go 'head, switch the style up
If niggas hate, then let 'em hate, and watch the money pile up""
Or we can go upside your head with a bottle of bub'
They know where we fuckin' be[Chorus]

The very first time he heard [me rap on] 'In Da Club' he said, 'Yo, I didn't think you was going to go there with it, but, you know, it works.' He was probably thinking of going in a different direction with that song. Then he expanded it into a hit record.""

The production was originally given to the hip-hop group D12, but was passed on to 50 Cent. The rapper recorded the track with only the drum beat present. Since much of the content on ""Get Rich or Die Tryin'"" was ""dark"", he wanted to write material that was ""the exact opposite"". He called the song a ""celebration of life. Every day it's relevant all over 'cause every day is someone's birthday."" <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/50+Cent/_/In+Da+Club"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

[Intro: Justin Bieber]
It don't make no sense 'less I'm doing it with you
It don't make no sense 'less I'm doing it with you
[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
The sun don't set the same
'Less you're watching it go down with me
The bed won't sleep the same
'Less you're waking up in here with me
Oh, my heart's a vacant house
When you're gone away, it's so empty
And love don't make sense when it's empty (Oh no)
[Pre-Chorus]
I've driven almost every car
It ain't the same when I'm without you
Been around a million stars
None of them shine brighter than you
The sky be so dark now without you
Yeah, ooh, baby
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
Oh been around the world
Ain't the same without you
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Focus ain't the same
If the picture ain't got you in it
In every line my
Emotions ain't the same
If it ain't about you, I don't get it
Ever since the beginning now
You had that effect on me
All I wanna do is you, oh
I mean that so literally
Don't nobody go harder than you
All of the angels must be lonely now, without you, woah
[Chorus: Justin Bieber (Travis Scott)]
It don't make sense, no
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
'Less I'm doing it with you baby
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
I only want to hear your voice, yeah
Oh, been around the world
Ain't the same without you
Had to find out the hard way
It don't make sense, no
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
(Going way up, way up)
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
(Way up, way up, way up)
(Yeah, slow down stay up, stay up, stay up)
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you[Verse 3: Travis Scott]
Time and time again I break a plan
Without you, girl I ain't the man
Could never be all I can be
You overstand, I'm incomplete
Apparently, gotta know I hate that
How I'm supposed to take that?
Boo'd up, missing all of that
Gotta be laying in that
Rolled up, put a flame to that
Thought by now you would have made it back
Be patient
Won't you pull up to me now?
Live forever young
It’s amazing
I don't want to sleep 'less you at home
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
It don't make sense, no
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
No, It don't make sense
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
No, it don't make sense

[Verse 1]
Put a price on emotion
I'm looking for something to buy
You've got my devotion
But man, I can hate you sometimes
I don't want to fight you
And I don't want to sleep in the dirt
We'll get the drinks in
So I'll get to thinking of her

We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line

Test of my patience
There's things that we'll never know
You sunshine, you temptress
My hand's at risk, I fold
Crisp trepidation
I'll try to shake this soon
Spreading you open
Is the only way of knowing you
Ooh, ooh[Chorus]

""'It was always gonna be the last song on the album. It felt like it described to me the process of making it and how the album felt in terms of the different kinds of songs on it.'""

In an interview with Zane Lowe, Harry touched on the extremity of the emotions he experienced while writing Fine Line:

""'What I hadn’t really experienced before during the making of this record, the times when I felt good and happy were the happiest I’ve ever felt in my life. And the times when I felt sad were the lowest that I’ve ever felt in my life.'""

Harry’s voice is accompanied by several instruments; horns, piano, guitars and strings to create a crescendo that concludes the album. Rolling Stone quoted Harry explaining the sonic choice, saying:

""'It started simple, but I wanted to have this big epic outro thing. And it just took shape as this thing where I thought, ‘That’s just like the music I want to make.’ I love strings, I love horns, I love harmonies — so why don’t we just put all of that in there?'"" <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Harry+Styles/_/Fine+Line"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

[Intro: John Lennon]
If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand?
'Cause I've been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands
[Verse 1: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
If I give my heart to you
I must be sure
From the very start that you
Would love me more than her
[Verse 2: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
If I trust in you, oh, please
Don't run and hide
If I love you too, oh, please
Don't hurt my pride like her
[Bridge: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I
Would be sad if our new love
Was in vain[Verse 3: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
So, I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two
[Bridge: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I
Would be sad if our new love

Structure
The song is notable for its unusual structure, which includes an unrepeated introductory section (introduced as an afterthought as of Take 11) followed by sequential verse sections, each having a slightly expanded form, but with no obvious chorus or bridge section. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/If+I+Fell"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","""If I Fell"" first appeared on the 1964 UK album A Hard Day's Night and the US compilation album Something New. It was written primarily by John Lennon, with help from Paul McCartney.

Structure
The song is notable for its unusual structure, which includes an unrepeated introductory section (introduced as an afterthought as of Take 11) followed by sequential verse sections, each having a slightly expanded form, but with no obvious chorus or bridge section. The song also features a two-part harmony, sung by Lennon and McCartney together into a single microphone at their suggestion, and intricate chord changes. The key changes from D flat major to D major between the introduction (a series of descending barre chords) and the main song, which uses mainly open chords, including an unusual D ninth.

Recording and performance
Lennon played acoustic guitar and sang, McCartney played bass and sang, George Harrison plucked out single notes on electric guitar, and Ringo Starr played drums.

There is an alternate take of the song in which McCartney's voice strains and cracks at the end of a line, which first appeared on the Love Songs compilation double-LP, by an archivist's error when returning to the master tapes in Capitol's vault. Since then, this version has appeared in many places and is often heard on oldies stations in some markets. This version is the stereo version now found in The Capitol Albums box set. In the mono version, Paul's voice strains, but does not crack.

The stereo mix of the song (found on the Hard Day's Night LP and Something New) features a double-tracked opening by John. This was also Kurt Cobain's favourite Beatles song, and was played by Nirvana whenever there were technical problems at their concerts.

""If I Fell"" was a part of The Beatles repertoire during The Beatles' US and Canadian tour in 1964. The group typically performed the song faster than the studio version, and Lennon and McCartney often sang it with barely suppressed laughter. On more than one occasion it was introduced as ""If I Fell Over"".

Single releases
    * UK: In the UK it was released on 4 December 1964 as A-side (b/w ""Tell Me Why"") on Parlophone DP 562
    * USA: It was also the B-side of the US single ""And I Love Her"" (Capitol 5235)
    * Norway: The song was released as a single in Norway, where it hit number one.

Cover versions
Maroon 5 performed an acoustic version of the song on their 1.22.03.Acoustic album. 
Evan Rachel Wood sang the song in the Across the Universe film. 
Sammy Kershaw performed a cover on the Come Together Tribute CD. 
Dominican band Caña Brava performed a merengue version on their 1994 album The Best of the Best.
Jason Castro performed an acoustic version of the song on Season 7 of American Idol. 
The Rutles' song track artist=The Rutles]With a Girl Like You is based on this song. Reba McEntire has also performed a version of the song. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/If+I+Fell"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

You like nine to five, I'm the weekend, oh
Make him lose his mind every weekend
You take Wednesday, Thursday, then just send him my way
Think I got it covered for the weekend[Verse 2]
I gotta say, I'm in the mood for a little bit more of that
I mean, I'm sayin', what kind of tease is two days?
I need me at least 'bout four of them, more of them
More you on me, on us, just tell me you want me, yeah, Monday
And I'll be at your door, ready to take her place
Ready to give you what you've been missin' on weekdays
What you've been waitin' for
10:30, no later than, drop them drawers
I know what you want
[Chorus]
My man is my man, is your man, heard it's her man too
My man is my man, is your man, heard that's her man
Tuesday and Wednesday, Thursday and Friday
I just keep him satisfied through the weekend
You like nine to five, I'm the weekend, oh
Make him lose his mind every weekend
You take Wednesday, Thursday (Don't worry 'bout none)
Then just send him my way (Don't worry 'bout none)
Think I got it covered for the weekend

[Verse 1]
You took my sadness out of context
At the Mariners Apartment Complex
I ain't no candle in the wind
I'm the board, the lightning, the thunder
Kind of girl who's gonna make you wonder
Who you are and who you've been
[Pre-Chorus]
And who I've been is with you on these beaches
Your Venice bitch, your die-hard, your weakness
Maybe I could save you from your sins
So kiss the sky and whisper to Jesus
My, my, my, you found this, you need this
Take a deep breath, baby, let me in
[Chorus]
You lose your way, just take my hand
You're lost at sea, then I'll command your boat to me again
Don't look too far, right where you are, that's where I am
I'm your man
I'm your man
[Verse 2]
They mistook my kindness for weakness
I fucked up, I know that, but Jesus
Can't a girl just do the best she can?
Catch a wave and take in the sweetness
Think about it, the darkness, the deepness
All the things that make me who I am[Pre-Chorus]
And who I am is a big-time believer
That people can change, but you don't have to leave her
When everyone's talking, you can make a stand
'Cause even in the dark, I feel your resistance
You can see my heart burning in the distance
Baby, baby, baby, I'm your man, yeah
[Chorus]
You lose your way, just take my hand
You're lost at sea, then I'll command your boat to me again
Don't look too far, right where you are, that's where I am
I'm your man
I'm your man

Catch a wave and take in the sweetness

[Chorus]
(Hey, Mama, ah, ow)
I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you, and uh
Let me tell you what I'm about to do
(Hey, Mama)
I know I act a fool, but I promise you, I'm goin' back to school, and
I appreciate what you allowed for me, and I
I just want you to be proud of me
(Hey, Mama)
[Verse 1]
I wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine
This little light of mine, I'm finna let it shine
I'm finna take y'all back to them better times
I'm finna talk about my mama if y'all don't mind
I was three years old when you and I moved to the Chi'
Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike
And you would give anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me a curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that, mommy, can't you see?
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes
'Cause a nigga cheatin', telling you lies, then I started to cry
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said, ""Mommy, I'ma love you 'til you don't hurt no more
And when I'm older, you ain't gotta work no more
And I'ma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford""
See, you're unbreakable, unmistakable
Highly capable lady that's makin' loot
A livin' legend too, just look at what Heaven do
Sent us an angel, and I thank you, Mama[Chorus]
(Hey, Mama, ah, ow)
I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you, and uh
Let me tell you what I'm about to do
(Hey, Mama)
I know I act a fool, but I promise you, I'm goin' back to school, and
I appreciate what you allowed for me, and I
I just want you to be proud of me
(Hey, Mama)
[Verse 2]
Forrest Gump mama said, ""Life is like a box of chocolates""
My mama told me, ""Go to school, get your doctorate
Something to fall back on, you could profit with""
But still supported me when I did the opposite
Now I feel like it's things I gotta get
Things I gotta do, just to prove to you
You was getting through, 
can the choir please
Give me a verse of ""You Are So Beautiful To Me""?
Can't you see, you're like a book of poetry
Maya Angelou, Nikki Giovanni
Turn one page and there's my mommy
Come on, Mommy, just dance wit' me
Let the whole world see your dancing feet
Now when I say ""Hey,"" y'all say, ""Mama""
Now everybody answer me, come on[Chorus]
(Hey, Mama, ah, ow)
I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do
(Hey, Mama)
I know I act a fool, but I promise you, I'm goin' back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me
(Hey, Mama)
[Break]
I guess it also depends though if my ends low
Second they get up, you gon' get that Benzo
Tint the windows, ride around the city and let your friends know (Hey, Mama)
Tell your job you gotta fake 'em out
Since you brought me in this world, let me take you out
To a restaurant, upper echelon
I'ma get you a Jag', whatever else you want
Just tell me what kind of 
S-Type Donda West like?
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right
It don't gotta be Mother's Day or your birthday
For me to just call and say
[Outro]
(Hey, Mama, ah, ow)
I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you, and uh
Let me tell you what I'm about to do
(Hey, Mama)
You know I love you so, and
I never let you go
Wrote this song just so you know
No matter where you go, our love is true

On the 10th anniversary of Donda West’s passing on November 10, 2017, a group of Kanye fans organized an event titled “Hey Mama Day”. The event aims to encourage fans to listen to the song with the hope of it reappearing on the Billboard Hot 100.

Raunchy like Bob Saget

I like when you come, never stay the whole night
Better when you high, never tell me I'm wrong

Stupid Lyrics
In “Stupid”, Musgraves rejects the concept of love as something that only leaves you hurt and broken.
[Verse 1]
Plays you like a fiddle, shakes you like a rattle
Takes away your gun and sends you into battle
Huffs and it puffs 'til it blows your house down
And you don't know your heart from a hole in the ground
[Pre-Chorus]
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh
[Chorus]
Stupid love is stupid
Don't know why we always do it
Finally find it just to lose it
Always wind up looking stupid, stupid
[Verse 2]
Girl meets boy, and boy, he's a looker
Can't separate the salt from the sugar
There's nothing in your pockets, there's footprints on your face
You can't tell anymore if you're the rabbit or the snake (Hey)
[Pre-Chorus]
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh[Chorus]
Stupid love is stupid
Don't know why we always do it
Finally find it just to lose it
Always wind up looking stupid, stupid
[Bridge]
I drink to feel
I smoke to breathe
Just look what love
Has done to me
[Chorus]
Stupid love is stupid
Don't know why we always do it
Finally find it just to lose it
Always wind up looking so damn
Stupid love is stupid

[Intro: Jay-Z]
Oh baby
Hahahaha
Turn the motherfuckin' music up
[Chorus]
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I've found, one thing I found
Oh, no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get 
down
, get up, I get 
down
Get up, I get 
down
, get up, I get 
down
Get up, I get 
down
, get up, I get down
[Over Chorus: Jay-Z]
That's right, it's what I do!
C'mon, uh-huh
Nah, you know I never let you down!
Gyeah, gyeah, yuh
[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Yo, first, I snatched the streets, then I snatched the charts
First, I had they ear, now I have they heart
Rappers came and went, I've been here from the start
I seen them put it together, watched them take it apart
Seen the Rovers roll up with ribbons
I seen them re-po'd, re-sold, then re-driven
So when I reload, he holds number one position
When you hot, I'm hot
And when your feet cold, mines is sizzling
It's plain to see, niggas can't fuck with me
'Cause I'ma be that nigga for life
This is not an image, this is God-given
This is hard-livin', mixed with Cristal sippin'
It's the most consistent, Hov
Give you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc and
Nigga, I'm home on these charts, y'all niggas visitin'
It's Hov tradition, Jeff Gordon of rap
I'm back to claim pole position, holla at ya boy[Chorus]
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I've found, one thing I found
Oh, no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get 
down
, get up, I get 
down
Get up, I get 
down
, get up, I get 
down
Get up, I get 
down
, get up
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I get down for my grandfather
 
who took my momma
Made her sit in that seat where white folks ain't want us to eat
At the tender age of 6, she was arrested for the sit-ins
And with that in my blood, I was born to be different
Now niggas can't make it to ballots to choose leadership
But we can make it to Jacob's or to the dealership
That's why I hear new music and I just don't be feelin' it
Racism still alive, they just be concealin' it
But I know they don't want me in the damn club
They even made me show ID to get inside of Sam's Club
I done did dirt and went to church to get my hands scrubbed
Swear I've been baptized 'least three or four times
But in the land where niggas praise Yukons and getting paid
It's gon' take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than durags to get you waves
Nothing sad as that day my girl father passed away
So I promised to Mr. Rainey, I'm gonna marry your daughter
And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
And I know that you were smiling when you seen the car I bought her
And you sent tears from Heaven when you seen my car get balled up
But I can't complain what the accident did to my left eye
'Cause look what an accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah, now Romeo must die
I know I got angels watching me from the other side[Chorus]
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I've found, one thing I found
Oh, no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get 
down
, get up, I get 
down
Get up, I get 
down
, get up, I get 
down
Get up, I get 
down
, get up, I get down
[Verse 3: J. Ivy]
We are all here for a reason on a particular path
You don't need a curriculum to know that you a part of the math
Cats think I'm delirious but I'm so damn serious
That's why I expose my soul to the globe, the world
I'm trying to make it better for these little boys and girls
I'm not just another individual
My spirit is a part of this, that's why I get spiritual
But I get my hymns from Him
So it's not me, it's He that's lyrical
I'm not a miracle, I'm a Heaven-sent instrument
My rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes for your soul and your mental
That's why I'm instrumental, 
vibrations is what I'm into
Yeah, I need my loot by rent day
But that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunta Kinte
I'm trying to get us ""us free"" like Cinque
I can't stop
, 
that's why I'm hot
Determination, dedication, motivation
I'm talking to you of my many inspirations
When I say I can't let you or self down
If I were on the highest cliff, on the highest riff
And you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life
In my grip, I would never, ever let you down
And when these words are found
Let it be known that God's penmanship has been signed with a language called love
That's why my breath is felt by the deaf
And while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
I, too, dream in color and in rhyme
So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house
'Cause whenever I open my heart, my soul or my mouth
A touch of God reigns out
Take 'em to church[Chorus]
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
Oh, no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get, get up, I get
Get up, I get, get up, I get
Get up, I get, get up, I get down
[Verse 4: Jay-Z & (Kanye West)]
Who else you know been hot this long?
(Oh yeah, we ain't finished)
Started from nothing but he got this strong
(The Roc is in the building)
Built the Roc from a pebble, peddled rock before I met you
Pedaled bikes, got my nephews pedal bikes because they special
 
(Wooooo)
Let you tell it, man, I'm falling
Well, somebody must have caught him
'Cause every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan 'em
Number one albums, what I got? Like four of them
More of them on the way, the eighth wonder on the way
Clear the way, I'm here to stay
Y'all can save the chitter chat, this and that
Dissin' Jay, dissin' Jay'll get you maced
When I start spitting them lyrics, niggas get very religious
Six Hail Marys, 'Please, Father forgive us'
Young, the archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y'all niggas
The way y'all all follow Jigga
Hov's a living legend and I'll tell you why
Everybody wanna be Hov and Hov's still alive",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-never-let-me-down-lyrics,"Originally recorded by Hov for his seventh studio album The Blueprint²: The Gift & The Curse, “Never Let Me Down” finds the track’s inherent hope being interpreted differently by the trio:

La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
[Verse 1]
I've never been so caught up
Still so into us
I never thought I'd be here
Should've turned to dust
Ooh, let's be honest, baby
This is so unusual
Ooh, I'm not tempted, baby
Even if they're beautiful
[Pre-Chorus]
I used to be cautious
A little too reckless
Now all my emotions
Are all 'cause of you
[Chorus]
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
I ain't even think of letting go
I ain't ever thought of going nowhere
I don't even see it down the road
'Cause we're collectin' moments
Tattoos on my mind
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
I ain't even think of letting go
Not even sometimes[Post-Chorus]

It used to be easy
For someone to steal me
Now all my emotions
Are all 'cause of you, boy
[Chorus]
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
I ain't even think of letting go
I ain't ever thought of going nowhere
I don't even see it down the road
'Cause we're collectin' moments
Tattoos on my mind
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
I ain't even think of letting go
Not even sometimes, babe[Bridge]
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Why it never worked, but it's going to now
You don't know, you don't know, you don't know
What it does to me when I feel you around
Is it love? Is it lust? Is it fear?
But it's hard to breathe when you're touching me there
Hard to breathe when you're kissing me there
Hard to breathe when you're not here
[Chorus]
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
I ain't even think of letting go
I ain't ever thought of going nowhere
I don't even see it down the road
'Cause we're collectin' moments
Tattoos on my mind
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
I ain't even think of letting go (Oh, yeah, baby)
Not even sometimes

[Verse 1]
You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like I'm nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when I'm wounded
You, pickin' on the weaker man
[Pre-Chorus]
Well, you can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know
[Chorus]
Someday, I'll be livin' in a big, ole city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
[Verse 2]
You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down, trying to block you out
'Cause I'll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again[Pre-Chorus]
I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now
'Cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know what you don't know
[Chorus]
Someday, I'll be livin' in a big, ole city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
[Bridge]
And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big, loud opinion
But nobody's listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumblin' on about how I can't sing
But all you are is mean
[Buildup]
All you are is mean
And a liar, and pathetic
And alone in life, and mean
And mean, and mean, and mean[Chorus]
But someday, I'll be livin' in a big, ole city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Yeah, someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
Someday, I'll be livin' in a big, ole city
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean

This song is rumored to be directed at blogger Bob Lefsetz, although nothing was officially confirmed. In addition, it also verses about the harsh criticism Taylor has received since her performance at the 52nd Annual Grammy awards, with Stevie Nicks, considered by many subpar.

Taylor Swift also explains the story behind ""Mean"" on her official website:
""The song ""Mean"" is about, well, when you do what I do, which is you put yourself out there for a lot of people to say whatever they want about it, there are a million different opinions from a million different people.

I get it that not everyone is going to like everything that you do, and I get that no matter what, you're going to be criticized for something. But I also get that there are different kinds of ways to criticize someone. There is constructive criticism. There's professional criticism. And then, there's just being mean. There's a line that you cross when you just start to attack everything about a person, and there's one guy who just crossed the line over and over again. Just being mean, and saying things that would ruin my day.

This happens…no matter what you do, no matter how old you are, no matter what your job is, no matter what your place is in life. There's always going to be someone who's just mean to you. Dealing with that is all you can control about that situation, how you handle it.

Can't never leave the crib without a murder wea-pon
Huh, I can't live my life on broke no mo'
And most of these fools ain't shit but cutthroats
They smile in a nigga face, and for what?
They got the game fucked up, and want my thing fucked up

The top notch nigga, I'm fiendin' for that spot
Now peep game on what Six-Deuce told me...

To slap you, like the bitch that you are, been wantin' to cap you
Every since you was mad doggin' me with that bitch in yo' car

[Intro: Pete Rock]
I'm with this
[Chorus: Pete Rock]
Complexion (Two-step)
Complexion don't mean a thing (It's a Zulu love)
Ooh, complexion (Two-step)
It all feels the same (It's a Zulu love)
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, dark as the midnight hour or bright as the mornin' sun
Give a fuck about your complexion, I know what the Germans done
Sneak (Dissin')
Sneak me through the back window, I’m a good field nigga
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down
Even if master listenin', cover your ears, he 'bout to mention
[Chorus: Pete Rock]
Complexion

It all feels the same

Uh, dark as the midnight hour, or bright as the mornin' sun
Brown skinned, but your blue eyes tell me your mama can't run
Sneak (Dissin')
Sneak me through the back window, I’m a good field nigga
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down
Even if master's listenin', I got the world's attention
So I'ma say somethin' that's vital and critical for survival
Of mankind, a feline color should never rival
Beauty is what you make it, I used to be so mistaken
By different shades of faces
Then Whit' told me, ""A woman is woman, love the creation""
It all came from God, then you was my confirmation
I came to where you reside
And looked around to see more sights for sore eyes
Let the Willie Lynch theory reverse a million times with...
[Chorus: Pete Rock]
Complexion

[Interlude: JaVonté & Kendrick Lamar]
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
(Where the homegirl Rapsody at?
I need you to speak your mind real quick, loved one!)[Verse 3: Rapsody]
Let me talk my Stu Scott, 'scuse me on my 2Pac
Keep your head up when the juice stop, loving thy
Color of your skin? Color of your eyes
That's the real blues, baby, like you met Jay's baby, uh
You blew me away, you think more beauty in blue, green and grey
All my solemn men up north, twelve years a slave
Twelve years of age, thinkin' my shade too dark
I love myself, I no longer need Cupid
Enforcin' my dark side like a young George Lucas
Light don't mean you smart, bein' dark don't make you stupid
And frame of mind for them bustas, ain't talkin' ""Woo-hah!""
Need a paradox for the pair of doc's they tutored
Like two Todd's, L-L, you lose two times
If you don't see you beautiful in your complexion
It ain't complex to put it in context
Find the air beneath the kite, that's the context
Yeah, baby, I'm conscious, ain't no contest
If you like it, I love it, all your earth tones been blessed
Ain't no stress, jiggaboos wanna be
I ain't talkin' Jay, I ain't talkin' Bey
I'm talkin' days we got school watchin' movie screens
And spike your self-esteem
The new James Bond gon' be black as me
Black as brown, hazelnut, cinnamon, black tea
And it's all beautiful to me
Call your brothers magnificent, call all the sisters queens
We all on the same team, blues and pirus, know colors ain't a thing[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
Barefoot babies with no care
Teenage gun toters that don't play fair, should I get out the car?
I don't see Compton, I see something much worse
The land of the landmines, the hell that's on earth",https://genius.com/Kendrick-lamar-complexion-a-zulu-love-lyrics,"""Complexion (A Zulu Love)"" contains additional vocals performed by Thundercat, Lalah Hathaway, Talkbox Monte, Javonte and Pete Rock.

In an interview, Kendrick described the song saying:

“The idea was to make a record that reflected all complexions of black women. There’s a separation between the light and the dark skin because it’s just in our nature to do so, but we’re all black. This concept came from South Africa and I saw all these different colors speaking a beautiful language.“

In the same interview, Rapsody said the original idea wasn’t for Kendrick to even have a verse, Kendrick wanted Prince to do the hook and have Rhapsody spit two verses.

Also note: A Tribe Called Quest, one of the pioneers of jazz rap, referenced the Universal Zulu Nation many times throughout their discography. The Universal Zulu Nation is described as an “organization of individuals in search of success, peace, knowledge, wisdom, understanding and the righteous way of life.”

Rapsody, who is featured in the song, was interviewed in 2015 and commented on quite a few things.

Regarding the recording process and working together, she responded, “[Kendrick] had the concept already when he reached out. There wasn’t much instruction. He told me the title, and that we are beautiful no matter our race but he really wanted to speak to our people and address this light versus dark complex”.

Regarding her actual opinion of the song she spoke about “growing up dealing with self-esteem issues in regards to the shade of my skin”. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Kendrick+Lamar/_/Complexion+(A+Zulu+Love)"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Beyoncé states out the gate that she will not be stopped 25 years in the game, exploring her unwanted claim to power that has arose not from material possession or her husband but because she is ‘that girl.

She would also make reference to the opening track on “ALIEN SUPERSTAR” with the lyrics embedded in the chorus: “I’m too classy for this world, forever, I’m that girl, Feed you diamonds and pearls, ooh, baby”.

Mother Lyrics
“Mother” is a song off Kacey Musgraves' 2018 album Golden Hour, describing her experience missing her mother.
[Verse]
Bursting with empathy
I'm feeling everything
The weight of the world on my shoulders
Hope my tears don't freak you out
They're just kinda coming out
It's the music in me and all of the colors
[Chorus]
Wish we didn't live
Wish we didn't live so far from each other
I'm just sitting here
Thinking 'bout the time that's slipping
And missing my mother
Mother
And she's probably sitting there
Thinking 'bout the time that's slipping
And missing her mother

[Verse 1]
Grew up in the same house
So I know why you lash out
Oh, I understand you
More than you think I do
Cracks in the windows
Castles and pillows
And all of the places
I built us to hide
[Verse 2]
I always left you out
You still loved me somehow
You just wanted a friend
Didn't know it then
But now I do
Our youth down the drain
And I'll take all of the blame
For all of the countless
Times that you cried
[Chorus]
Just two kids caught in the crossfire
Close your eyes, I know you're so tired
Just kids, you and I, I know it's hard sometimes
But you'll be alright, we'll be alright[Verse 3]
All that's unspoken
All the years that werе stolen
You were still in that housе
I shouldn't have left you behind
And I fall to pieces
Sometimes all that you need is
A shoulder to cry
And I'm lucky that you're mine
[Chorus]
Just two kids caught in the crossfire
Close your eyes, I know you're so tired
Just kids, you and I, I know it's hard sometimes
But you'll be alright, we'll be alright
[Bridge]
Aah
Aah
We'll never change as time fades
Aah

Just two kids caught in the crossfire

At Least For Now Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I'm concerned when you look at my face
You're excited for no reason
I look lost with a drink in my hand
What you think is fair ain't even even
It's cold outside from my expression
Take the scarf and wrap it around my neck
Loosen up my tie

Trying to avoid disappointment
At least for now
One finger at a time, I turn the pages, yeah

Right leg crossed while you're smokin' a cigarette
Camera's on the couch, ain't nobody takin' pictures
Throw my arms around you, bear witness
The stripes on my shirt, can you read between the lines?
You sip champagne while I sip on red wine
Never mind me watchin' you, never mind the tension
Please excuse me while I dance, I forgot to mention
I'm going on strike

[Verse 1]
I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered for just us to know
You told me you loved me, so why did you go away?
Away
[Verse 2]
I do recall now, the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement
, 
I ran off the plane
That July ninth, the beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt, I can still feel your arms
[Pre-Chorus]
But now I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss
[Chorus]
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips
[Verse 3]
I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in
I'm not much for dancing, but for you, I did
Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions[Pre-Chorus]
And I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss
[Chorus]
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips, ooh
[Bridge]
So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I'll keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are
[Verse 4]
And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you you wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in the weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind
[Pre-Chorus]
So, I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss[Chorus]
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

Going through a breakup you feel all of these different things. You feel anger, and you feel confusion, and frustration. Then there is the absolute sadness. The sadness of losing this person, losing all the memories, and the hopes you had for the future. There are times when you have this moment of truth where you just admit to yourself that you miss all these things. When I was in one of those moments I wrote this song.""

That bitch a clown put her in the circus
Doin' all thе petty stupid shit on purpose (
Hey

My brotha' stolen seal and I might purchase
Walk up in the store and see what I'mma get
Yo freaky bitch on me and she givin' neck
Bitch I almost died up in a car wreck

Pop a bullet get to flyin' like a bird (man)
Had to call 'em thotties tell 'em what is the word (man)
Put me in the streets a nigga gettin' heard (man)
Walk around the way bro make a U-turn
Stupid bitch takin' away the shit I earn
I went down bad but I'm still in first

Much like the album’s opener, “Everything in its Right Place”, it is distinguished by a conspicuous lack of guitars and heavily compressed vocals from Yorke.

While some of the lyrics make clear references to literature and politics, it is unlikely that Thom intended for the song itself to carry a clear intellectual meaning. The severe distortion applied to the lead vocal track makes understanding the lyrics difficult, a creative choice that removes the emphasis from the words themselves, and places it almost exclusively on the sound the band have created from Thom’s voice. Additionally, “Kid A” is comprised of lines that Yorke selected randomly by writing them on slips of paper and pulling them out of a hat. So while the individual lines clearly held meaning for Yorke, they did so as individual statements rather than parts contributing to a whole.

Instead, it seems like the band's “meaning” for the song arises from their own creative process as well as the emotional experience the music delivers to its audience.

“On ‘Kid A’, the lyrics are absolutely brutal and horrible and I wouldn’t be able to sing them straight. But talking them and having them vocodered through Johnny’s Ondes Martenot, so that I wasn’t even responsible for the melody… that was great, it felt like you’re not answering to this thing.” -Yorke, The Wire, July 2001.

The way they achieved the vocal effect of the track was by putting Thom’s monotone speaking voice through a Vocoder-like filter and using a Ondes Martenot, a keyboard like instrument, to control the pitch of the filter, to simulate singing. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/_/Kid+A"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

[Verse 1]
Run fast from my day job
Runnin' fast from the way it was
Jump quick to a paycheck
Runnin' back to the strip club
I'm never goin' back, never goin' back
No, you can't make me
Never goin' back, never goin' back (Nah)
They'll never take me
I've paid enough of petty dues
I've heard enough of shitty news
I've had a thing for dirty shoes since I was ten
Love dirty men alike

Better day than yesterday (Keep cuttin' up)
Ooh
I just take it day by day
Ooh, oh
Never hearing what they say (Uh)
Ooh-ooh (Mm)

All I got is these broken clocks
I ain't got no time
Just burnin' daylight
Still love, and it's still love, and it's still love
It's still love, still love (Still love), still love
It's still love, it's still love
Nothin' but love for you (Nothin' but)
Nothin' but love (Nothin' but)
Nothin' but love[Post-Chorus]
All that I've got, pieces and pages
Talkin' a lot, sorry, I'm faded
 (Turnin' up real good tonight)
Think I forgot you love me (Think I forgot the other night)
You love me, you love me
[Verse 2]
Got a shift at 10 AM (Yeah)
Gotta dip at 10 PM (Nah)
Gotta get that cash
Won't get past a lunch break
I ain't had a smoke break
In about two days, don't break (Ugh)
Been about three years since I dated you
Why you still talkin' 'bout me like we together?
I moved on for the better, you moved on to whoever
I was down for whatever and then some
You gon' make me late to work again
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh
Better day than yesterday
Ooh
I just take it day by day
Ooh, oh
Never hearing what they say
Ooh-ooh
I just do it my way (Keep doin' it)[Chorus]
All I got is these broken clocks
I ain't got no time
Just burnin' daylight
Still love, and it's still love, and it's still love
It's still love, still love, still love (Still love)
It's still love, and it's still love (Still love)
Nothin' but love for you
Nothin' but love (Nothin' but)
Nothin' but love

I don't eat, can't sleep past 9 AM
Heartbeat make me feel young again (Make me feel like a—)
Can't beat 'em, just join the party (Let me join the party)
I don't wanna, don't need nobody

[Verse 1]
She cuts you once, she cuts you twice
But still you believe
The wound is so fresh
You can taste the blood
But you don't have strength to leave
You've been bought, you've been sold
You've been locked outside the door
But you stand there pleading
With your insides bleeding
Cause you deep down want some more
[Chorus]
When she says she wants forgiveness
It's such a clever masquerade
She's so good with her stiletto
You don't even see the blade
You don't even see the blade
[Verse 2]
She cuts you hard, she cuts you deep
She's got so much skill
She's so fascinating
That you're still there waiting
When she comes back for the kill
You've been slashed in the face
You've been left there to bleed
You want to run away
But you know you're gonna stay
Cause she gives you what you need[Chorus]
Then she says she needs affection
While she searches for the vein
She's so good with her stiletto
You don't really mind the pain
You don't mind the pain
Oh
[Verse 3]
She cuts you out, she cuts you down
She carves up your life
But you won't do nothing
As she keeps on cutting
Cause you know you love the knife
You've been bought, you've been sold
You've been locked outside the door
But you stand there pleading
With your insides bleeding
'Cause you deep down want some more

This song is a great metaphor, of course the woman in this song is not using a literal knife, it’s actually a metaphor for emotional manipulation. There are 3 other Billy songs with same kind of “femme fatale” type of meaning to them: ""She’s Always a Woman"", ""All for Leyna"", and ""Laura"".

In this uptempo track from his sixth studio album, Billy Joel sings about an irresistible but dangerous woman who wields emotional manipulation like a sharp blade. In 2016, Joel told SiriusXM that the song's staccato piano riff was inspired by the riff that opens Traffic's 1969 song ""Shanghai Noodle Factory.""

On ""52nd Street"", a jazzy send-up to Manhattan's night life, Joel reunited with Phil Ramone, who produced his breakthrough album, ""The Stranger"", the previous year. For its follow-up, Ramone encouraged him to shift his musical direction and experiment with jazz. The album won two trophies at the 1980 Grammy Awards: Best Pop Vocal Performance - Male and Album Of The Year. According to Ramone, the funky bass lines, finger snaps, and cliffhanger breaks were incorporated after Joel listened to the first playbacks and decided the song needed a visceral hook to create the necessary tension. ""Memorable fills, phrases, and breaks - such as the one heard on 'Stiletto' - are what set the best records apart,"" Ramone wrote in his 2007 book ""Making Records: The Scenes Behind The Music"". ""These devices are especially effective when they're heard at the beginning of a song; if you can come up with something spicy and unique, you've got a better chance of getting (and holding) the audience's attention.""

Ramone explained how drummer Liberty DeVitto unexpectedly nailed the sound effect of a switchblade clicking open: ""It had rained that day, so we got an umbrella and Liberty practiced opening it so the timing would be right. We begin recording... here comes the take... and SNAP! The umbrella flew right off the top of the handle. The timing - and the sound - couldn't have been better."" <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Billy+Joel/_/Stiletto"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

I remember
[Verse 1]
Good girl, sad boy
Big city, wrong choices
We had one thing goin' on
I swear that it was somethin'
'Cause I don't remember who I was
Before you painted all my nights
A color I've searched for since
But one thing after another
Fuckin' situations, circumstances
Miscommunications, and I
Have to say, by the way
I just may like some explanations
[Chorus]
Can I ask you a question?
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
And every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you
But fifteen seconds later, thеy were clappin' too?
Then what did you do?
Did you lеave her house in the middle of the night? Oh
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh
When she said it was too much?
Do you wish you could still touch her?
It's just a question[Verse 2]
Half-moon eyes, bad surprise
Did you realize out of time?
She was on your mind with some dickhead guy
That you saw that night
But you were on somethin'
It was one drink after another
Fuckin' politics and gender roles
And you're not sure and I don't know
Got swept away in the gray
I just may like to have a conversation
[Chorus]
Can I ask you a question?
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
And every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you
But fifteen seconds later, they were clappin' too?
Then what did you do?
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh
When she said it was too much?
Do you wish you could still touch her?
It's just a question
[Bridge]
Does it feel like everything's just like
Second best after that meteor strike?
And what's that that I heard? That you're still with her?
That's nice, I'm sure that's what's suitable
And right, but tonight[Chorus]
Can I ask you a question? (Can I ask you a question?)
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room (In a crowded room)
And every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you (Makin' fun of you)

[Verse 1]
I didn't think you'd understand me
How could you ever even try?
I don't wanna tiptoe, but I don't wanna hide
But I don't wanna feed this monstrous fire
Just wanna let this story die
And I'll be alright

Me and my truth, we sit in silence
Mm
Baby girl, it's just me and you

You got me misunderstood
But at least I look this good[Chorus]

Know that you made me
I don't like how you paint me, yet I'm still here hanging
Not what you made me
It's somethin' like a daydream
But I feel so seen in the night
So for now, it's only me
And maybe that's all I need
[Chorus]
We can't be friends
But I'd like to just pretend
You cling to your papers and pens
Wait until you like me again[Post-Chorus]

Night Prowler Lyrics
This song is about a guy who is slipping in a girl’s bedroom to get her. Possibly a stalker with a crush even if Richard Ramirez took a wrong interpretation of it.
[Instrumental Intro]
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 1]
Somewhere, a clock strikes midnight
And there's a full moon in the sky
You hear a dog bark in the distance
You hear someone's baby cry
A rat runs down the alley
And a chill runs down your spine
And someone walks across your grave
And you wish the sun would shine
'Cause no one's gonna warn you
And no one's gonna yell ""attack""
And you don't feel the steel
'Til it's hangin' out your back
[Chorus]
I'm your night (
Night
) prowler
I sleep in the day
Night (
Night
) prowler
Get out of my way
Yeah, I'm the night (
Night
) prowler
Watch out tonight
Yes, I'm the night (
Night
) prowler
When you turn out the light, oh[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 2]
Too scared to turn your light out
'Cause there's somethin' on your mind
Was that a noise outside the window?
What's that shadow on the blind?
As you lie there naked
Like a body in a tomb
Suspended animation
As I slip into your room
[Chorus]
I'm your night (
Night
) prowler
I sleep in the day
Yeah, I'm the night (
Night
) prowler
Get out of my way
Look out for the night (
Night
) prowler, haha
Watch out tonight
Yes, I'm the night (
Night
) prowler
When you turn out the light
[Guitar Solo]
Oh
Oh[Chorus]
I'm your night (
Night
) prowler
I sleep in the day
Yes, I'm the night (
Night
) prowler
Get out of my way
Look out for the night (
Night
) prowler, ow
Watch out tonight
Yes, I'm the night (
Night
) prowler
When you turn out the light
I'm your night (
Night
) prowler, oh
Break down your door
I'm your night (
Night
) prowler
Crawlin' cross your floor
Yeah, I'm out for the night (
Night
) prowler
Make a mess of you
 (Yes, I will)
Night (
Night
) prowler

There ain't nothin', oh
Nothin' you can do

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
Bad luck to talk on these rides
Mind on the road, your dilated eyes watch the clouds float
White Ferrari, had a good time
Sweet sixteen, how was I supposed to know anything? (Love)
I let you out at Central
I didn't care to state the plain
Kept my mouth closed
We're both so familiar
White Ferrari, good times
[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Stick by me, close by me
You were fine, you were fine here
That's just a slow body
You left when I forgot to speak
So I text the speech, lesser speeds, Texas speed, yes
Basic takes its toll on me 'ventually, 'ventually, yes
Ah, on me 'ventually, 'ventually, yes
I care for you still, and I will forever
That was my part of the deal, honest
We got so familiar
Spending each day of the year
White Ferrari, good times
[Bridge: Frank Ocean & 
Kanye West
]
In this life (Life), in this life (Life)
One too many years
Some tattooed eyelids on a facelift
Thought you might want to know now
Mind over matter is magic, I do magic
If you think about it, it'll be over in no time
And that's life
 
(Love)
Love (
Love
)[Verse 3: Frank Ocean]
I'm sure we're taller in another dimension
You say we're small and not worth the mention
You're tired of movin' (Woo), your body's achin' (Woah)
We could vacay, there's places to go
Clearly, this isn't (The way) all that there is
Can't take what's been given (No way)
But we're so okay here (We're fine), we're doing fine (We're fine)
Primal and naked
You dream of walls that hold us in prison (Love)
It's just a skull, least that's what they call it
And we're free to roam",https://genius.com/Frank-ocean-white-ferrari-lyrics,"The heartbreaking “White Ferrari” is the fourteenth song on Frank Ocean’s second album ""Blonde"". Of great emotional depth, the track speaks volumes about love and permanence.

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Wakin' up all alone ain't better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around
Turn me back like woah-woah, woah-woah, oh-oh-oh
Woah, woah-woah, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?
[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Yeah, do you see us in Vegas pushin' a Monte Carlo?
Bet that money on baby, bet she don't leave me, oh, no
See them heat waves in the desert, look like a lake in the sand
Would you watch the sun burn out with me forever, ever, ever, ever?
You still intimidate me, keep me up on my toes now
Better man, what you made me
Made me aware of what I was missin'
Been missin' the way you give me envision, babe
Never thought I'd settle down, reckon I lied to myself
I was busy focusin' on bein' by myself
Set my feelings to the side, they all got dusty on a shelf
You wiped them down when I had nothin' left
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Wakin' up all alone ain't better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around
Turn me back like woah-woah, woah-woah, oh-oh-oh
Woah, woah-woah, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?[Verse 2: Post Malone]
When you asked me if I cheated, I said never (No way)
What are you willing to do to stay together? ('Gether)
How many times we gonna break up for the summer?
How many times you gonna try to call my mother? (Brrr-brrr)
Girl, you're killin' me, I don't wanna act like I can fix this (Fix it, fix it)
I don't wanna be the one that's changed since Texas
Currency, it comes so naturally, but I can't buy your love
[Chorus: Justin Bieber & 
Post Malone & Justin Bieber

Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?

Woah, woah-woah, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?
[Verse 3: Clever]
I promise I'm gonna love you 'til my dying day
Wake up, your face in my chest, your favorite hiding place
The roof is gone as we're driving out the private gate
Countin' the stars with our last name on the license plate
Woah, oh, oh, oh
I lied to myself 'bout trying to be here all alone
When I leave, it's bye for now, it's just never bye for long
Set my feelings aside, let's settle down
Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Turn me back like woah-woah, woah-woah, oh-oh-oh
Woah, woah-woah, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?

Last Call Lyrics
On The College Dropout’s final track (hence the title), Kanye West tells his story from being just a producer to the Yeezy we all know and love.

The track was originally produced by fellow rapper/producer…

[Produced by Evidence & Kanye West]
[Intro: JAY-Z]
Aight, let's run it, let's run it
Yo fuck you, Kanye, first and foremost
For making me do this shit. Muh'fucker
Had to throw everybody out the motherfucking room
'Cause they don't fucking--
[Kanye West]
I'd like to propose a toast
I said toast, motherfucker!
[Chorus: Kanye West]
And I am
(Here's to the Roc)
And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them
(Here's to Roc-A-Fella)
Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky and
(Here's to the Roc)
This is the last call for alcohol, for the
(Mr. Rockefeller)
So get your ass up off the wall
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
The all around the world Digital Underground Pac
The Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer of the Roc
I take my chain, my fifteen seconds of fame
And come back next year with the whole fucking game
Ain't nobody expect Kanye to end up on top
They expected that 
College Dropout
 to drop and then flop
Then maybe he stop savin' all the good beats for himself
Roc-A-Fella's only niggas that helped
My money was thinner than Sean Paul's goatee hair
Now Jean Paul Gaultier cologne fill the air,
 here
They say he bougie, he big-headed
Would you please stop talking about how my dick head is
Flow infectious, give me ten seconds
I'll have a buzz bigger than insects in Texas
It's funny how wasn't nobody interested
'Til the night I almost killed myself in Lexus[Chorus: Kanye West]
Now I am
(Here's to the Roc)
And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them
(Here's to Roc-A-Fella)
Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky and
(Here's to the Roc)
This is the last call for alcohol, for the
(Mr. Rockefeller)
So get your ass up off the wall
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Now was Kanye the most overlooked? Yes sir
Now is Kanye the most overbooked? Yes sir
Though the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest
But all they got left is this guy called West
That'll take Freeway, throw him on tracks with Mos Def
Call him 
Kwa-li or Kwe-li,
 
I put him on songs with JAY-Z
I'm the Gap like Banana Republic and Old Navy, and oooh
It come out sweeter than old Sadie
Nice as Bun-B when I met him at the Source awards
Girl he had with him - ass coulda won the horse awards
And I was almost famous,
 
now everybody love Kanye
I'm almost Raymond
Some say he arrogant, can y'all blame him?
It was straight embarrassing how y'all played him
Last year shoppin' my demo, I was tryin' to shine
Every motherfucker told me that I couldn't rhyme
Now I could let these dream killers kill my self-esteem
Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams
I use it as my gas, so they say that I'm gassed
But without it I'd be last, so I ought to laugh
So I don't listen to the suits behind the desk no more
You niggas wear suits 'cause you can't dress no more
You can't say shit to Kanye West no more
I rocked 20,000 people, I was just on tour, nigga
I'm Kon, the Louis Vuitton Don
Bought my mom a purse, now she Louis Vuitton Mom
I ain't play the hand I was dealt, I changed my cards
I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars
I went to the malls and I balled too hard
""Oh my god, is that a black card?""
I turned around and replied, ""Why yes
But I prefer the term African American Express""
Brains, power, and muscle
Like Dame, Puffy, and Russell
Your boy back on his hustle
You know what I've been up to
Killin y'all niggas on that lyrical shit
Mayonnaise-colored Benz, I push Miracle Whips[Chorus: Kanye West]
And I am
(Here's to the Roc)
And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them
(Here's to Roc-A-Fella)
Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky and
(Here's to the Roc)
This is the last call for alcohol, for my niggas
(Mr. Rockefeller)
So get your ass up off the wall
[Outro]
So this A&R over at Roc-A-Fella, named Hip Hop Picked the ""Truth"" beat for Beanie. And I was in the session with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do. I play the songs, he's like ""Who that spittin'?"" I'm like ""It's me."" He's like ""Oh, well okay.""
Uhh, he started talkin' to me on the phone, going back and forth
Just askin' me to send him beats, and I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, 'cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin' with
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
And um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. And No ID told him, ""Look, man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap""
No ID: ""Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap""
[Saxophone Solo]I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer
[Hiphop: ""I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper""]
I'm like oh shit. I was messin' with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game.
 If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know, after they picked that ""Truth"" beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin' off like that. I was stayin' in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin' like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then
I made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample
 
I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, ""Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin', called 
The Dynasty
.
 And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me So I went and um, 
I was listening to Dre 
Chronic 2001
 at that time.
 
And really I just, like bit the drums off ""Xxplosive"" and put it like with a sped-up sample, and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on ""This Can't Be Life.""
And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on 
The Dynasty
 album.
 I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop 'cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin' 'cause I been there for a while. I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change. Try to move up to the next level. 
And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet JAY-Z and he said, ""Oh you a real soulful dude.""
[JAY-Z: ""Oh you a real soulful dude, man""]
And he, uh, played the song 'cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio. You know how he do it, one take
. 
And he said
[JAY-Z: ""Check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here""]
""Tell me what you think of this."" And I heard it, and I was thinking like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type JAY-Z. I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. So he asked me, ""What you think of it?""
[JAY-Z: ""So what you think of this?""]
And I was like, ""Man that shit tight,"" you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him?
 I was on the train, man, you know. So after that, I went back home. 
And man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin' really like poppin' off the way it should have been.
 
One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain't have to deal with the landlord 'cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to...
[Donda West: ""Come on, let's just go""]
...Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up...
[Donda West: ""Kanye, baby, we're here""]
...I unpacked all my shit.
 
You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself.
 
I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, ""Heart of the City.""
 
And Beans was still working on his album at that time
, 
so I came up there to Baseline,
 it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats. And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did ""Nothing Like It"" already at that time but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. 
And Hip-hop said, ""Yo play that one beat for him."" And I played ""Heart of the City."" And
 
really I made ""Heart of the City,"" I really wanted to give that beat to DMX
[Hiphop: ""No I think Jay gon' like this one right here""]
And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.'
 
Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, ""Yo what's up I'm Kanye.""
[Dame: ""Yo, you that kid, Kanye?""]
""You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay?
 
Yo, this nigga got classics to your beats""
[Dame: ""Jay got classics, G.""]
You know I ain't talkin' shit. I'm like ""oh shit."" And all this time I'm starstruck, man.
 
I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show, 
The Streets is Watching
, I'm lookin', these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know.
 So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, ""yo Jay I could rap."" 
And I spit this rap that said, uh ""I'm killin' y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips."" And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. He said, ""Man that was tight.""
[JAY-Z: ""That, that was cool. That was hot.""]
That was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward. 
So, 
Blueprint
, ""H to the Izzo,"" my first hit single.
 And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people. 
My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course, later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that.
 
And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's
, 
and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. ""Gimme a beat that sound like JAY-Z."" You know, they dick riders.
 Whatever. 
So I'll play them these post-
Blueprint
 beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll be like, ""yo but I rap too."" Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy 'cause you know, 'cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever.
 
Everybody out there listen here: I played them ""Jesus Walks"" and they didn't sign me.
 
You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say, ""Naw."" Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me,
 my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. 
Jessica Rivera, man...
[Jessica: ""Man, you niggas is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real.""]
I'm not gonna say nothin' to mess my promotion up
[""Y'all niggas is stupid""]
Let's just say I didn't get my deal. 
The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know? The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records. He wanted to sign me really bad
[Joe: ""We gonna change the game, buddy.""]
Dame was like, ""Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay, man, just make sure it's not wack.""
[Dame: ""You gotta make sure it's not wack.""]
Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, 'cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and Dame was in the room.
 
So I played... actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'
""I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow
I got 11 plaques on my walls right now
You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow.""
Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So I play that song for him
 
and he's like ""oh shit""
[Dame: ""Oh shit it's not even wack.""]
""I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot.""
[Dame: ""it's actually kinda hot.""]
Like they still weren't looking at me like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'Like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know
. 
So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like ""yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick""
[Dame: ""you don't wanna catch a brick""]
""You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on.""
 I told Hip-hop and Hip-hop was all, ""oh, word?"" Actually, even with that, I was still about to take the deal with Capitol 'cause it was already on the table and 'cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you know, 'cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. 
Then, you know, I'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, ""oh he's just a producer-rapper,""
 and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right-- the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. Man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said, ""yo... Capitol pulled on the deal""
[Mel: ""Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal.""]
And, you know I told them that Roc-A-Fella was interested and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. 
I went up... I called G, I said, ""man, you think we could still get that deal with Roc-A-Fella?""
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?

After Jay decided not to use the track, Kanye took it and re-produced it, which Evidence explained in an interview with HipHopDX:

""The reason it says [it was] produced by both of us [is because] the sample didn’t clear. He went and had an orchestra come in and replay shit. A musicologist, he really took it to a level I couldn’t have musically. Instruments were played on top, he added drums to my drums and he really took it there. I think the version I turned in to him was just as raw because I love the loop and the drum sound of it, but his is really well-produced. So when it says it was produced by both of us, it’s well-deserved. I’m not disputing that or anything like that.""

[Intro]
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
[Verse 1]
You tell me that I'm complicated
And that might be an understatement
Anything else? (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
You tell me that I'm indecisive
Fickle, but I try to hide it
Anything else? (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
You tell me that I overthink
'Til I ruin a good thing
Anything else? (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
You tell me that you'd rather fight
Than spend a single peaceful night
With somebody else (Ha-ha-ha-ha)
[Pre-Chorus]
You really, really know me
The future and the old me
All of the mazes and the madness in my mind
You really, really love me
You know me and you love me
And it's the kind of thing I always hoped I'd find, yeah
[Chorus]
Always thought I was hard to love
'Til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy
Always thought I was hard to love
'Til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy
Touch me 'til I find myself in a feeling
Tell me with your hands that you're never leaving (No)
Always thought I was hard to love
'Til you made it seem so easy (Seem so easy)[Verse 2]
I never liked my crooked teeth
You tell me they're your favorite thing (Mm-hmm)
Anything else? (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
The stretch marks all around my thighs
Kiss 'em 'til I change my mind
About everything else (Ha-ha-ha-ha)
[Pre-Chorus]
You really, really know me
The future and the old me
All of the mazes and the madness in my mind
You really, really love me
You know me and you love me (Ah)
And it's the kind of thing I always hoped I'd find
[Chorus]
Always thought I was hard to love
'Til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy (So easy, yeah)
Always thought I was hard to love
'Til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy (So easy, yeah)
Touch me 'til I find myself in a feeling (Oh)
Tell me with your hands that you're never leaving (Oh, never)
Always thought I was hard to love (To love, yeah)
'Til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy (Oh)[Bridge]
All I know is you
Heal me when I'm broken
Heal me when I'm broken, oh
All I know is you
Saved me and you know it
Saved me and you know it (Saved me and you know it, ah)

Always thought I was hard to love
'Til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy (Ah)
I always thought I was hard to love

[Verse 1]
Ended up on a crossroad
Tried to figure out which way to go
It's like you're stuck on a treadmill
Running in the same place
You got your hazard lights on now
Hoping that somebody would slow down
Praying for a miracle
Ooh show your grace
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas
With a long journey ahead
Seen a truck pull over
God sent an angel to help you out
He gave you direction
Showed you how to read a map
For the long journey ahead
Said it ain't over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt
[Chorus]
Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again[Verse 2]
Relationship on a ski slope
Avalanche comin' down slow
Do we have enough time to salvage this love?
Feels like a blizzard in April
Cause my heart, it's just that cold
Skating on thin ice
But it's strong enough to hold us up
Seen her scream and holler
Put us both on blast
Tearing each other down
When I thought it was over
God sent in an angel to help us out
He gave us direction, showed us how to make it last
For that long journey ahead
Said it ain't ever over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt
[Chorus]
Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again
Life is worth living again[Bridge]
What I get from my reflection
Is a difference in perception?
From what the world may see
They tried to crucify me
I ain't perfect, won't deny
My reputation's on the line
So I'm working on a better me

Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes
Only God can judge me

Stuck thinkin' 'bout it drivin' on the freeway
Wonderin' if I really tried everything I could
Not knowin' if I should try a little harder

[Intro: The Kid LAROI]
Uh-uh, uh-uh
Unstable
[Verse 1: Justin Bieber & 
The Kid LAROI
]
Sometimes I think I overthink (
Think I
)
And I start to feel anxiety (
Anxie—
)
There were times I couldn't even breathe (Mmm)
But you never once abandoned me (
No, you never, ooh
)
[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber, 
Justin Bieber & The Kid LAROI
]
I tried to 
scare you, scare you away
Showed you the 
door, you adored me anyway
When I was broken in pieces
You were my peace of mind, you were my peace of 
mind
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Yeah, you loved, yeah, you loved, yeah, you loved me when I was unstable
Never judged, never judged, never judged me when I was unable
To love myself, to trust myself
Yeah, you loved, yeah, you loved, yeah, you loved me when I was unstable
[Verse 2: The Kid LAROI]
White knuckles tryna hold my sanity (Hold my)
Not every wound is the kind that bleeds, uh, uh
Never know when my mind's gonna turn on me (Never know)
But you're the one I call for security (Oh, baby)
These memories have been toxic (Oh)
I tried to wean and get off it (Oh)
Through everything, you been my rock
I think you're the only thing I didn't get wrong
Oh, I know God was listening
Every night when I would pray
You're an angel watchin' over me (Oh)
All I need[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber, 
Justin Bieber & The Kid LAROI

I tried to 
scare you, scare you away
Showed you the 
door, you adored me anyway
When I was broken in pieces
You were my peace of mind, you were my peace of mind
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Yeah, you loved, yeah, you loved, yeah, you loved me when I was unstable
Never judged, never judged, never judged me when I was unable
To love myself, to trust myself

ONEWE -  AuRoRa (English Translation) Lyrics
[Verse 1: Yonghoon, 
Dongmyeong
]
I follow this light that leads to you
I follow this white path
Remaining in the hidden time
We walk on the same path
From the lingering scent of you
I take out the blurred memories and bring them back to me
My time that's been passing by
Is silently going back to find you who shined brightly
[Pre-Chorus: CyA]
Red, blue and purple on top
Above that, we are in love
The light is so bright even in the middle of the night
And I assume that you are the light
The aurora that you gave me
Always shines purple, even when it passes by me
[Chorus: Yonghoon]
I got this on my way
AuRoRa
It cross over my head
Go ahead (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
[Post-Chorus: Dongmyeong]
Clear the clouds that cover you
Shine brighter with the light in the dark night
Please stay with me
Stay a little longer with the light in the dark night[Verse 2: Yonghoon, 
Dongmyeong
]
I'll leave behind the regretful feelings that still remain
And write the endings of the unfinished stories
Between the countless stars
The night sky is filled with only your light
[Pre-Chorus: CyA]
A picturesque night, but the sky is bright
After wandering along many galaxies
I regain my senses
Now I hold your hand
The aurora that you gave me
Always shines purple, even when it passes by me
[Chorus: Yonghoon]
I got this on my way
AuRoRa
It cross over my head
Go ahead (Ooh, ooh- ooh)
[Bridge: Dongmyeong]
Before the dark sky leaves
I will remember you
The moon that stayed for a while
I'll reach for you and light up this night[Chorus: Yonghoon]
I got this on my way
AuRoRa
It cross over my head
Go ahead (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
[Post-Chorus: Dongmyeong]
Clear the clouds that cover you
Shine brighter with the light in the dark night
Please stay with me

[Verse 1]
Draw the cat eye sharp enough to kill a man
You did some bad things, but I'm the worst of them
Sometimes, I wonder which one'll be your last lie
They say looks can kill and I might try
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't dress for women
I don't dress for men
Lately, I've been dressin' for revenge
[Chorus]
I don't start shit, but I can tell you how it ends
Don't get sad, get even
So on the weekends
I don't dress for friends
Lately, I've been dressin' for revenge
[Verse 2]
She needed cold, hard proof, so I gave her some
She had the envelope, where you think she got it from?
Now she gets the house, gets the kids, gets the pride
Picture me thick as thieves with your ex-wife
[Pre-Chorus]
And she looks so pretty
Drivin' in your Benz
Lately, she's been dressin' for revenge[Chorus]
She don't start shit, but she can tell you how it ends
Don't get sad, get even
So on the weekends
She don't dress for friends
Lately, she's been dressin' for revenge
[Bridge]
Ladies always rise above
Ladies know what people want
Someone sweet and kind and fun
The lady simply had enough
[Verse 3]
While he was doin' lines and crossin' all of mine
Someone told his white-collar crimes to the FBI
[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't dress for villains
Or for innocents
I'm on my vigilante shit again
[Chorus]
I don't start shit, but I can tell you how it ends
Don't get sad, get even
So on the weekends
I don't dress for friends

Somebody Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Every time I wake up next to you, I talk to God
And I'm so damn grateful 'cause you make up for the things I'm not
Didn't know I needed nothin' 'til I needed you ('Til I needed you)
In a world that's spinnin', it ain't easy letting go
Eight billion people were just lookin' for a hand to hold
Everybody's tryna find someone to hold on to (Hold on to)

It's okay, it's okay, we all try to pretend that we're brave
When I'm weak, yeah, I'm strong 'cause of you at the end of the day

Everybody needs somebody (Everybody needs somebody)
Somebody to remind you that you're not alone
Who gon' defеnd you like an army? (Gon' defend you likе an army)
And never let go? (Never let go)
Yeah, everybody needs somebody (Everybody needs somebody)
Somebody to wake up to when everyone's gone
So if you need me, then you got me (If you need me, then you got me)
I'll be the shoulder you cry on
[Post-Chorus]
Everybody needs some–
Everybody needs somebody[Verse 2]
Every time I look at you, I'm lookin' at a star
It's the way you light up every room just bein' who you are
Didn't know I needed nothin' 'til I needed you ('Til I needed you, ooh-woah)
But before I met you, I never believed in magic
But you stole my heart before anyone knew you had it
I know (Yeah, yeah), that you know (Yeah, yeah), what we got, it don't come easy

It's okay, it's okay, we all try to pretend that we're brave
When I'm weak, yeah, I'm strong 'cause of you at the end of the day

Everybody needs somebody (Everybody needs somebody)
Somebody to remind you that you're not alone
Who gon' defend you like an army? (Gon' defend you like an army)

Oh, I'm scared if I look in your eyes, I might see your soul
I know love is the loneliest place when you fall alone

Spending all night wondering why you let me go (You let me go)
I wish you had felt how you're feeling two years ago
Oh, nah

Hurts me to hurt you, baby
Lying awake and everything has changed
Keeping our distance lately
Kills me to kill you when I tell you
That I felt it once, I can't feel it twice

Hurts me to tell you I don't feel the same

I can feel you still staring at me when I look away
Can't imagine the pain that you feel when I kiss his face[Pre-Chorus]

[Intro]
Study long, study wrong, nigga
Hey, y'all close that front door, y'all let flies in this motherfucker
Close that door!
My OG up in this motherfucker right now
My pops man with the bottle of Hennessy in his hand, actin' a fool
Hey, hey, babe, check it out, I'ma tell you what my mama had said, she like:
[Verse 1]
I could spot you a mile away
I could see your insecurities written all on your face
So predictable your words, I know what you gonna say
Who you foolin'? Oh, you assuming you can just come and hang
With the homies but your level of realness ain't the same
Circus acts only attract those that entertain
Small talk, we know that it's all talk
We live in the Laugh Factory every time they mention your name
[Refrain]
Askin' ""where the hoes at?"" to impress me
Askin' ""where the moneybags?"" to impress me
Say you got the burner stashed to impress me
It's all in your head, homie
Askin' ""where the plug at?"" to impress me
Askin' ""where the juug at?"" to impress me
Askin' ""where it's at?"" only upsets me
You sound like the feds, homie[Chorus]
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard
[Verse 2]
And the world don't respect you
And the culture don't accept you
But you think it's all love
And the girls gon' neglect you once your parody is done
Reputation can't protect you if you never had one
Jealousy (Complex), emotional (Complex)
Self-pity (Complex), under oath (Complex)
The loudest one in the room, nigga, that's a complex
Let me put it back in proper context
[Chorus]
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard[Refrain]
Askin' ""where the hoes at?"" to impress me
Askin' ""where the moneybags?"" to impress me

)
[Verse 3]
What do you got to offer?
Tell me before we off ya, put you deep in the coffin
Been allergic to talkin', been a virgin to bullshit
And sell a dream in the auction, tell me just who your boss is
Niggas be fugazi, bitches be fugazi
This is for fugazi
Niggas and bitches who make habitual lyin' babies
Bless them little hearts
You can never persuade me
You can never relate me to him, to her, or that to them
Or you,
 
the truth you love to bend
In the back, in the bed, on the floor, that's your ho
On the couch, in the mouth, I'll be out, really though
See, loud, rich niggas got low money
And loud, broke niggas got no money
The irony behind it is so funny
And I seen it all this past year
Pass on some advice we feel:[Chorus]
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga

It’s a powerful message of the figurative purgatory that rappers and entertainers can enter if they are not stratospherically successful, yet not anonymous enough to return to their hood without receiving unwanted attention. There are racial undertones here, and the use of stereotypical black imagery paints Kendrick as a hood figure; but it can be applied to other aspects in life, where you feel pressure to perform or act a certain way.

Kendrick’s rational side is warning the listener not to lie for respect or personal gain. This furthers the album’s message, as portrayed in tracks like “For Sale? (Interlude)” and “For Free? (Interlude),” where he criticizes those who think rap is inherently about money and power. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Kendrick+Lamar/_/You+Ain%27t+Gotta+Lie+(Momma+Said)"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Somebody slow it down[Pre-Chorus]
This is way too hard
'Cause I know when the sun comes up
I will leave, this is my last glance
That will soon be memory

And when the daylight comes, I'll have to go
But tonight, I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight, we'll be on our own
But tonight, I need to hold you so close

Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, oh

I never want it to stop
Because I don't wanna start all over, start all over
I was afraid of the dark
But now it's all that I want, all that I want, all that I want

But tonight, I'm gonna hold you so close

[Verse 1]
Used to spend my nights out in a barroom
Liquor was the only love I'd known
But you rescued me from reachin' for the bottom
And brought me back from bein' too far gone
[Chorus]
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time
[Verse 2]
I've looked for love in all the same old places
Found the bottom of a bottle's always dry
But when you poured out your heart, I didn't waste it
'Cause there's nothin' like your love to get me high
[Chorus]
And you're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time
[Guitar Solo][Chorus]
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey, Tennessee whiskey
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey

Real Friends Lyrics
“Real Friends” is an introspective track from Camila Cabello in which she struggles to find genuine friends:

This song is about feeling lonely and disilluded by people in LA while I was away from home

[Verse 1]
No, I think I'll stay in tonight
Skip the conversations and the ""Oh, I'm fine's""
No, I'm no stranger to surprise
This paper town has let me down too many times
Why do I even try?
Give me a reason why
I thought that I could trust you, never mind
Why all the switching sides?
Where do I draw the line?
I guess I'm too naive to read the signs
[Chorus]
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
All they ever do is let me down
Every time I let somebody in
Then I find out what they're all about
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
Wonder where they're all hidin' out
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
Gotta get up out of this town (Oh, ooh)
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, yeah
[Verse 2]
I stay up, talkin' to the moon (Ooh)
Been feelin' so alone in every crowded room
Can't help but feel like somethin's wrong, yeah
'Cause the place I'm livin' in just doesn't feel like home[Chorus]
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
All they ever do is let me down
Every time I let somebody in
Then I find out what they're all about
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
Wonder where they're all hidin' out
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
Gotta get up out of this town
[Post-Chorus]
Oh
Lookin' for some real friends
Oh, oh-oh
[Bridge]
I just wanna talk about nothin' with somebody that means something
Spell the names of all the dreams and demons for the times that I don't understand
Tell me, what's the point of a moon like this when I'm alone again?
Can I run away to somewhere beautiful where nobody knows my name?
[Chorus]
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
All they ever do is let me down
Then, I let somebody in
But I find out what they're all about
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
All they ever do is let me down
I'm just lookin' for some real friends

Scenes from an Italian Restaurant Lyrics
“Scenes from an Italian Restaurant” has the longest duration in all of Billy Joel’s catalog, clocking in at 7 minutes and 37 seconds. While never released as a single, it has always been highly regarded… 
Read More
 
[Intro]
A bottle of white, a bottle of red
Perhaps a bottle of Rosé instead
We'll get a table near the street
In our old familiar place
You and I, face to face
 – mmm
A bottle of red, a bottle of white
It all depends upon your appetite
I'll meet you anytime you want
In 
our Italian restaurant
[Segue]
[Verse 1]
Things are okay with me these days
Got a good job, I got a good office
I got a new wife, got a new life
And the family is fine
Oh, we lost touch long ago
You lost weight, I did not know
You could ever look so nice after so much time
[Verse 2]
Do you remember those days hanging out at the 
Village Green
?
Engineer boots, leather jackets and tight blue jeans
Oh, you'd 
drop a dime in the box
, 
play a song about New Orleans
Cold beer, hot lights
My sweet romantic teenage nights[Segue]
(Ooh, ooh...)
(Yeah, yeah yeah!)
(Ooh... oh, oh...)
(Oh, oh, oh...)
[Verse 3]
Brenda and Eddie were the popular steadies
And the King and the Queen at the prom
Riding around with the car top down and the radio on
Nobody looked any finer
Or was more of a hit at the Parkway Diner
We never knew we could want more than that out of life
Surely, Brenda and Eddie would always know how to survive
Ohh, ohh, ohhh-oh
Ohh, ohh, ohhh-oh
[Verse 4]
Brenda and Eddie were still goin' steady in the summer of '75
When they decided the marriage should be at the end of July
Everyone said they were crazy
“Brenda, you know that you're much too lazy
And Eddie could never afford to live that kind of life”
Oh, but there we were, waving Brenda and Eddie goodbye
Ohh, ohh, ohh...[Verse 5]
Well, they got an apartment with deep pile carpets
And a couple of paintings from Sears
A big waterbed that they bought with the bread
They had saved for a couple of years
They started to fight when the money got tight
And they just didn't count on the tears
Ohh, ohh...
[Segue]
Yeah, rock and roll!
[Saxophone solo]
Ohh, ohh, ohh...
[Verse 6]
Well, they lived for a while in a very nice style
But it's always the same in the end
They got a divorce, as a matter, of course
And they parted, the closest of friends
Then the king and the queen went back to the green
But you can never go back there again
No, ohh...
[Verse 7]
Brenda and Eddie had it already by the summer of '75
From the high to the low to the end of the show
For the rest of their lives
They couldn't go back to the Greasers
The best they could do was pick up their pieces
We always knew they would both find a way to get by
Ohh, and that's all I heard about Brenda and Eddie
Can't tell you more, 'cause I told you already
And here we are waving Brenda and Eddie goodbye
Ohh, ohh, ohhh-oh
Ohh, ohh, ohhh-oh
Ohh, ohh, ohhh-oh[Segue]
Oh, yeahh, yeahh, yeah...!
[Reprise]
Bottle of red
Ooh, a bottle of white
Whatever kind of mood you're in tonight
I'll meet you anytime you want
In our Italian restaurant

[Intro]
Mm
[Verse 1]
I fall asleep cryin'
You turn up the TV
You don't wanna hear me
One more sleepless night
Big day in the morning
So, I take my time to self-soothe
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm too much for you
So I really gotta do
The thing I don't wanna do
No, I don't, don't, don't, don't
[Chorus]
I don't wanna fuck with your head
It's breakin' my heart
To keep breakin' yours again (Yours again, yours again, yours again)
This situationship has to end
But I just can't refuse
I don't wanna break up again (Up again, up again, up again), baby
[Verse 2]
I made it so easy
Spent so much on therapy
Blamed my own codependency
But you didn't even try
When you finally did, it was at the wrong time
Won't abandon me again for you and I, I[Pre-Chorus]
I'm too much for you
So I really gotta do
The thing I don't wanna do
No, I don't, don't, don't, don't

I don't wanna fuck with your head
It's breakin' my heart (Breakin' my heart)
To keep breakin' yours again (Yours again, yours again, yours again)
This situationship has to end
But I just can't refuse
I don't wanna break up again (Up again, up again, up again)
[Bridge]
We both know it's time
So we say goodbye
Just one kiss goodbye
With tears in our eyes
Hope you won't, won't regret me
Hope you'll still think fondly of our little life
[Chorus]
I don't wanna fuck with your head
It's breakin' my heart (Breakin' my heart)
To keep breakin' yours again (Yours again, yours again, yours again)
This situationship has to end
But I just can't refuse
I don't wanna break up again (Up again, up again, up again), baby[Outro]
(Hah, hah, hah)

Don't wanna break up again (Breakin' my heart)
I don't wanna, baby

[Verse 1]
Just as you take my hand
Just as you write my number down
Just as the drinks arrive
Just as they play your favourite song
As your bad day disappears
No longer wound up like a spring
Before you've had too much
Come back in focus again
The walls are bending shape
They've got a Cheshire cat grin
All blurring into one
This place is on a mission
Before the night owl
Before the animal noises
Closed circuit cameras
Before you're comatose
[Verse 2]
Before you run away from me
Before you're lost between the notes
The beat goes 'round and 'round
The beat goes 'round and 'round
I never really got there
I just pretended that I had
Words are blunt instruments
Words are sawn-off shotguns
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Before you run away from me
Before you're lost between the notes
Just as you take the mic
Just as you dance, dance, dance[Chorus]
A jigsaw falling into place
So there is nothing to explain
You eye each other as you pass
She looks back, and you look back
Not just once, and not just twice
Wish away your nightmare
Wish away the nightmare
You got the light, you can feel it on your back
A light, you can feel it on your back

The song was previously known as ""Open Pick"", a title it was given provisionally when it was performed during Radiohead's 2006 tour.

The song has spent several weeks as one of the 100-most-played songs on US modern rock radio, so far peaking at #69,[4] receiving more support than any other In Rainbows song with the exception of ""Bodysnatchers"", which has hit #8 on the Billboard Modern Rock Chart[5], and House of Cards which has peaked at #48 

The track reached #30 in the UK singles chart on its first week of release, their lowest ranking chart entry since ""Lucky"" in 1995. However, ""Jigsaw"" was the first Radiohead single since the band's inception not to be released through EMI-controlled Parlophone, their former major record label. The single was instead released in the UK by independent label XL Records.

Time magazine named ""Jigsaw Falling Into Place"" one of The 10 Best Songs of 2007, ranking it at #5. Writer Josh Tyrangiel praised the song’s “tightness” whose rise in intensity he likened to a three-act play, and described the song as “a journey through flirtation, consummation and regret [that] gets about as close as you can to summing up a doomed relationship in four minutes.”

I Don’t Need ’Em Lyrics
[Intro]
Yeah
It is what it is, man
Uh-huh
[Verse 1]
Sirens flashin' you know the routine, the crime scene taped off
It started out a robbery, they blew half his face off
They seen him shinin', cross full of diamonds he bought grindin'
His foot slip off the ladder of success he was climbin'
The D's came through, askin' niggas if they know what happened
Somehow my name end up in anythin' that involves clappin'
Detectives at my mama crib, they say they wanna question me
They put me in a lineup last time and they arrested me
When it come to cookin' coke, they know I got the recipe
I turn a quarter to a half, that's why they mess with me
I'm the neighborhood pusher, I move packs to make stacks
A little weed, a little X, a little H, little crack
Figure, I'll push it to the limit, take the shit to the max
Navy blue vest on, navy blue Yankee hat
Calm, in my palm's fully loaded firearm
First to let off last to run, every time it's on
[Chorus]
I tell niggas to suck my dick, get the fuck out my face
'Cause I don't need 'em
'Cause they're, never around, when I'm down
Shot and I'm bleedin'[Break]
(What? Nigga is there.. is there a motherfuckin' problem nigga?)
(Oh, yeah that's what I, I thought so.. pussy!)
[Verse 2]
Niggas be talkin 'bout me, they always callin' me crazy
Fuck them OG niggas, they stuck in the 80's
Sayin they gon' do me somethin', now you know that's a lie
Nigga you look at me wrong 
I let the hammer fly
I'm rich, I still wake up, with crime on my mind
Queens nigga put it down like Pappy Mason in his prime
When I say move, nigga move, or get caught in the crossfire
I prevents runnin', cut my fuckin' hand on the barbed wire, shit's crazy
Just a different day it's the same shit
Hollow-tip partin' yo' head, leave your whole fuckin' brain split
They sick, they see me in that Aston Martin
What's the matter? They can't get that hooptie started
Thought they was grindin', well God damn, where that money at?
Thought you was fucked up, cause you was lettin' paper stack
You ain't a hustler, matter fact, you's a buster
I don't trust ya, I should send niggas to touch ya
[Chorus]
I tell niggas to suck my dick, get the fuck out my face
'Cause I don't need 'em
'Cause they're, never around, when I'm down
Shot and I'm bleedin'[Outro]
What? Who say they gon' do somethin' to me?
Must be out your rabbit-ass mind
Fuck around kill one of these niggas",https://genius.com/50-cent-i-dont-need-em-lyrics,"",""

[Verse 1]
I love the taste of you in the morning
Keep me warm and
Nothin' else, nothin' more important
Makes me wanna believe in love (Mmm)
I love the thought of us in the evening
Crave the feeling
The way you feel, somethin' 'bout it's healing
I'm praying we don't fuck this up (Ah-ah-ah, babe)
[Pre-Chorus]
Others that I've had had to impress me before
But I knew you were the real thing
When you walked through the door
I didn't think that I would have to spell it out

Don't put the bands, put the bands on me
Oh, my love, oh, my love is free
Ain't no price on my loyalty
No shit, got me right where you want me, baby
Could I be more obvious? (Ooh)
Hard to think when I'm under you
Tell you all of my dirty truths
No shit, got me right where you want me, baby
Could I be more obvious?[Verse 2]
Maybe if I'm lucky, you might stay the afternoon
If you gotta work, just promise me you'll come back soon
Maybe you should pack a suitcase too (Too)
I love the thought of you never leavin' (No)
Days repeatin'
Gettin' steps up on the treadmill while you sleepin'
Never thought I'd believe in love again
[Pre-Chorus]
Others that I've had had to impress me before (Ooh)
But I knew you were the real thing
When you walked through the door
I didn't think that I would have to spell it out

Oh, my love, oh, my love is free
Ain't no price on my loyalty

“Better Than Revenge” is rumored to be about actress Camilla Belle, who infamously stole Joe Jonas' heart while he was dating Taylor.

Further evidence proves that this song is about Camilla Belle, if you…

[Intro]
Now, go stand in the corner and think about what you did (Ha)
Haha, time for a little revenge
[Verse 1]
The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and
I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say ""Sabotage""
I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from
[Chorus]
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, woah
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha
[Verse 2]
She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling and
She thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things
But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Oh, they didn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
(Think about what you did)[Chorus]
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, woah
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha
[Bridge]
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but haven't you heard?
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but I always get the last word
Woah, woah-ah-oh
[Chorus]
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah (She deserved it)
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, woah
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge[Outro]
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
'Cause I don't think you do, oh (No, no, no, no)
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing? (No)
I don't think you do, I don't think you do
Let's hear the applause (Come on, come on)
Come on, show me how much better you are
(So much better, yeah?)
See, you deserve some applause
'Cause you're so much better

[Verse 1]
How dare you say that my behavior's unacceptable
So condescending, unnecessarily critical
I have the tendency of getting very physical
So watch your step, 'cause if I do, you'll need a miracle
You drain me dry and make me wonder why I'm even here
The double vision I was seeing is finally clear
You want to stay, but you know very well I want you gone
Not fit to fuckin' tread the ground that I am walking on
[Chorus]
But when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
""There's no way we're gonna give up"" (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And like a little girl cries in the face
Of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
[Verse 2]
What you are doing is screwing things up inside my head
You should know better, you never listened to a word I said
Clutching your pillow and writhing in a naked sweat
Hoping somebody someday will do you like I did[Chorus]
But when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
""There's no way we're gonna give up"" (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And like a little girl cries in the face
Of a monster that lives in her dreams
She said, is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
[Bridge]
And does it kill? Does it burn? Is it painful to learn
That it's me that has all the control?
Does it thrill? Does it sting when you feel what I bring
And you wish that you had me to hold?
[Chorus]
But when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
""There's no way we're gonna give up"" (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And like a little girl cries in the face
Of a monster that lives in her dreams

Wednesday morning at five o'clock as the day begins
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes downstairs to the kitchen
Clutching her handkerchief
Quietly turning the backdoor key
Stepping outside, she is free

Sacrificed most of our lives

Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband
""Daddy, our baby's gone
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly?
How could she do this to me?""

We never thought of ourselves

Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade

What did we do that was wrong?

Is having (
We didn't know it was wrong

So I started to get the lyrics: she slips out and leaves a note and then the parents wake up ... It was rather poignant. I like it as a song, and when I showed it to John, he added the long sustained notes, and one of the nice things about the structure of the song is that it stays on those chords endlessly. Before that period in our song-writing we would have changed chords but it stays on the C chord. It really holds you. It's a really nice little trick and I think it worked very well.

    While I was showing that to John, he was doing the Greek chorus, the parents' view: 'We gave her most of our lives, we gave her everything money could buy.' I think that may have been in the runaway story, it might have been a quote from the parents. Then there's the famous little line about a man from the motor trade; people have since said that was Terry Doran, who was a friend who worked in a car showroom, but it was just fiction, like the sea captain in ""Yellow Submarine"", they weren't real people.""

The newspaper story McCartney mentioned was from the front page of the Daily Mirror, about a girl named Melanie Coe. Although McCartney made up most of the content, Coe, who was 17 at the time claims that he got most of it right. Her parents wondered why she had left... ""She has everything here."" In real life, Melanie did not ""meet a man from the motor trade"", but instead a croupier, and left in the afternoon while her parents were at work. She was found ten days later because she had let slip where her boyfriend worked.[2]

Coincidentally, Coe had met McCartney three years earlier when she was a contestant and prize winner on ITV's Ready Steady Go!.[3] An update on Melanie appeared in the Daily Mail in May 2008.[4]

Don’t Be a Fool Lyrics
“Don’t Be A Fool” was released by Canadian-artist Shawn Mendes on September the 15th as a promotional single for his album Illuminate, released a week after, on September the 23th.
[Verse 1]
You've got my heart, but I can't let you keep it, babe
'Cause I won't be sure that I can stay
And don't waste your time trying to pull me in
'Cause I'm just a mess you don't wanna fix
Just promise me one thing that you won't forget
But for now, kiss me softly before I say
[Chorus]
And don't be a fool
And wait on me, darling
I know that you don't wanna hear this
But I'm always on the move
And don't be a fool
And say that you love me
'Cause you'll find a man who will stand by your side
And will be there for you
[Verse 2]
And just know that I do, oh, I really like you, babe
And I wanna be there for you for the rest of your days, no
But I know that you'll hurt if we keep on doing this
So I'm sorry to end this now, but I know that it's for the best
[Chorus]
Don't be a fool
And wait on me, darling, yeah
I know that you don't wanna hear this
But I'm always on the move
And don't be a fool, yeah
And say that you love me
'Cause you'll find a man who will stand by your side
And will be there for you[Bridge]

I don't think you'll ever understand

And wait on me, darling
I know that you don't wanna hear this
But I'm always on the move, yeah, oh

[Produced by Terrace Martin & Larrance Dopson; Additional production by Sounwave]
[Directed by Colin Tilley & The Little Homies]
[Poem: Kendrick Lamar]
I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence
Sometimes, I did the same
[Intro: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk—
Sex
[Verse 1: Anna Wise & 
Kendrick Lamar
]
She just wanna close her eyes and sway
With you, with you, with you (
Ah, come on
)
Exercise her right to work it out
It's true, it's true, it's true
Shout out to the birthday girls
Say hey (Hey), say hey (Hey, 
ah, girl
)
Everyone deserves a night to play (Play)
She plays, only when you tell her no[Chorus:

Thundercat

If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I'm in it, I love it when I'm in it
 (
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
)
Oh, oh
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
These walls could talk, they'd tell me to swim good
No boat, I float better than he would
No life jacket, I'm not the God of Nazareth
But your flood can be misunderstood
Walls tellin' me they full of pain, resentment
Need someone to live in 'em just to relieve tension
Me, I'm just a tenant
Landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute
These walls are vulnerable, exclamation
Interior pink, color coordinated
I interrogated every nook and cranny
I mean, it's still amazing, before, they couldn't stand me
These walls wanna cry tears
These walls happier when I'm here
These walls never could hold up
Every time I come around, demolition might crush
[Chorus: 
Anna Wise,
 
Thundercat
, & 
Bilal
]
If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I'm in it, I love it when I'm in it
 (
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
)
Oh, oh[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
These walls could talk, they'd tell me to go deep
Yellin' at me continuously, I can see
Your defense mechanism is my decision
Knock these walls down, that's my religion
Walls feelin' like they ready to close in
I suffocate, then catch my second wind
I resonate in these walls
I don't know how long I can wait in these walls
I've been on the streets too long
Lookin' at you from the outside in
They sing the same old song
About how they walls always the cleanest
I beg to differ, I must've missed them
I'm not involved, I'd rather diss 'em
I'd rather call on you, put your wall up
'Cause when I come around, demolition gon' crush
[Chorus: 
Anna Wise,
 
Thundercat
, & 
Bilal

If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you

If your walls could talk, they'd tell you it's too late
Your destiny accepted your fate
Burn accessories and stash 'em on the yard
Take the recipe, the Bible and God
Wall tellin' you that commissary is low
Race wars happenin', no callin' CO
No callin' your mother to save you
Homies to say you're irrepetible, not acceptable
Your behavior is Sammy the Bull like
A killer that turned snitch
Walls is tellin' me you a bitch
You pray for appeals hopin' the warden would afford them
That sentence so important
Walls tellin' you to listen to ""Sing About Me""
Retaliation is strong, you even dream 'bout me
Killed my homeboy and God spared your life
Dumb criminal got indicted same night
So when you play this song, rewind the first verse
About me abusin' my power so you can hurt
About me and her in the shower whenever she horny
About me and her in the after hours of the morning
About her baby daddy currently servin' life
And how she think about you until we meet up at night
About the only girl cared about you when you asked her
And how she fuckin' on a famous rapper
Walls can talk (Talk)
[Poem: Kendrick Lamar]
I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in a hotel room",https://genius.com/Kendrick-lamar-these-walls-lyrics,"""These Walls"" is a song by American rapper Kendrick Lamar.

Flew into town, not to hotel, but to the town house
I send the drop, they hit the drop, we brought the drops out (
On God

Travis seems to think that bringing these women to his hotel room will bring them closer to utopia, and that his surface level fantasies can fulfill his own fantasy. However, as exemplified in “CIRCUS MAXIMUS”, falling into the lifestyle of what is assumed from the public will only bring one to their own dystopia; on the surface it may seem they’ve reached peace, but it only brings torture to the soul.

This track’s title “TOPIA TWINS” contains an interesting omission of the letter “U” from utopia. It might be a subtle reference to false utopias and dystopias, meaning Travis is aware of his own shortcomings. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Travis+Scott/_/TOPIA+TWINS"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

[Interlude: Diana Garland]
When we're all born, Saturn's somewhere
And the Saturn cycle takes around about twenty-nine years
That's when we gotta wake up and smell the coffee
Because if we've just been sort of relying on our cleverness
Or relying—, you know, just kind of floating along
Saturn comes along and hits you over the head
Hits you over the head, hits you over the head, and says, ""Wake up""
Aha, it's time for you to get real about life and sort out who you really are

Wake up
Get real",https://genius.com/Ariana-grande-saturn-returns-interlude-lyrics,"The spoken track, “Saturn Returns Interlude”, goes into the lessons of a Saturn Return. A Saturn Return happens approximately every 29.5 years, when Saturn completes a full rotation around the sun, returning to the exact placement it was on your birthday.

[Intro: Frank Ocean]
Now, to the edge, I'll race
To the end, I'll make it
All the risk, I'll take it
Headbang with my faux friends
We pour a taste out for the dead
This is the blood, the body
The life right now
The height right now
Might be what I need
Might be what I need
Said you wanna hurt me now
You can't hurt me now
That might be what you need
[Verse: Frank Ocean]
What it means to be alive (Now)
On this side (You wanna kill me now)
On this side (Don't let me down)
On this side (Down, down)
Fuck the other side (Now)
I'm on this side
I'm on this side
I'm on this side (Now)
How it feels to have arrived
I'm inside
I'm inside
Those are my niggas for life (Now)
Mothers of us, be kind
To the fathers on whom we rely
Fathers of us, be kind
To the mothers on whom we rely (Now)[Bridge: Frank Ocean]

[Verse 1]
Four years old, with my back to the door
All I could hear was the family war
Your selfish hands always expecting more
Am I your child, or just a charity ward?
[Pre-Chorus]
You have a hollowed out heart, but it's heavy in your chest
I try so hard to fight it, but it's hopeless
Hopeless, you're hopeless

Oh, father
Please, father
I'd love to leave you alone, but I can't let you go
Oh, father
Please, father
Put the bottle down for the love of a daughter
Oh

It's been five years since we've spoken last
And you can't take back what we never had
Oh, well, I can be manipulated only so many times

You have a hollowed out heart, but it's heavy in your chest
I try so hard to fight it, but it's hopeless

Don't you remember I'm your baby girl?
How could you push me out of your world?
Lied to your flesh and your blood
Put your hands on the ones that you swore you loved
Don't you remember I'm your baby girl?
How could you throw me right out of your world?
So young when the pain had begun
Now forever afraid of being loved

[Verse 1]
All the ladies of the canyon
Wearing black to their house parties
Crosby, Stills and Nash is playing
Wine is flowing with Bacardi
[Pre-Chorus]
But sometimes, girls just want to have fun
The poetry inside of me is warm like a gun
[Chorus]
I bought me a truck in the middle of the night
It'll buy me a year if I play my cards right
Photo-free exits from baby's bedside
'Cause they don't yet know what car I drive
I'm just tryna keep my love alive
With my bartender, hold me all night
Bartender, our love's alive
Baby, remember, I'm not drinking wine
But that Cherry Coke you serve is fine
And our love's sweet enough on the vine
Bartender, bar-t-t-tender

All the ladies of the canyon
Wearing white for their tea parties
Playing games of levitation
Meditating in the garden[Pre-Chorus]
And I love the little games that we play
From the valley to the beach
And when at last the day is done, I grab my keys

I bought me a truck in the middle of the night
It'll buy me a year if I play my cards right
Photo-free exits from baby's bedside

I'm just tryna keep my love alive
With my bartender, hold me all night
Bartender, our love's alive
Baby, remember, I'm not drinking wine
But that Cherry Coke you serve is fine
And our love's sweet enough on the vine
Bar-t-t-tender, bar-t-t-tender, bar-t-t-tender
Ha, ha, ha, ha
[Outro]
I bought me a truck in the middle of the night
60 MPH on PCH drive
Here to Long Beach to Newport by your side
As they don't yet know where I reside
60 miles from the last place I hide
With my bar-t-t-tender, hold me all night
Bar-t-t-tender, keep love alive

The protagonist, however, is more interested in keeping her love and relationship with the bartender alive than in attending these parties.

The lyrics suggest that the protagonist bought a truck in the middle of the night to keep her whereabouts secret, and she is happy to be away from the baby's bedside because the baby does not know what kind of car she drives. The Cherry Coke the bartender serves seems to suffice as the protagonist's drink of choice. The lyrics imply that the protagonist is trying to maintain a low profile to keep her love and relationship with the bartender alive.

The song's title ""Bartender"" represents a strong longing for human connection. The bartender is not just serving drinks but providing emotional support to the protagonist, who seeks solace in his company.

In conclusion, ""Bartender"" is a song about the protagonist's desire to keep her love life alive with the help of a bartender. It's a reflection of how the protagonist values human connection and prefers to keep her relationship out of the public eye. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Lana+Del+Rey/_/Bartender"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song was written by John Lennon at his Aunt Mimi’s house in Menlove Avenue, Liverpool.
‘Please Please Me’ is my song completely. It was my attempt at writing a Roy Orbison song, would you believe it? I wrote it in the bedroom in my house at Menlove Avenue, which was my auntie’s place… I remember the day and the pink coverlet on the bed and I heard Roy Orbison doing ‘Only The Lonely’ or something. That’s where that came from. And also I was always intrigued by the words of ‘Please, lend me your little ears to my pleas’ – a Bing Crosby song. I was always intrigued by the double use of the word ‘please’. So it was a combination of Bing Crosby and Roy Orbison. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/Please+Please+Me"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Posters, an advertising method not unfamiliar to Harry, for Eroda were also spotted in New York. Interestingly, the cryptic image posted by Harry also features fishes that resemble the logo of Eroda. “Eroda” is “Adore” backwards, tying the mythical island in the video back in with the title of the track.

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar & 
Ronald Isley
]
Is this mic on?
 (
Hey, move this way, this way
)
Hey, hey, hey, turn the mic up, c'mon, c'mon
Is the mic on or not? I want the mic
We're bringing up nobody, nobody
Nobody but the number one rapper in the world
He done traveled all over the world
He came back just to give you some game
All of the little boys and girls, come up here
(Ah, one two, one two, what's happening, fool?)
Come right here, this is for you, come on up
I done been through a whole lot (
Kendrick Lamar
)
Trial, tribulation, but I know God
The Devil wanna put me in a bow tie (
Make some noise, brother
)
Pray that the holy water don't go dry, yeah, yeah
As I look around me
So many motherfuckers wanna down me
But enemigo never drown me
In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
And I love my (
I love myself
)
Huh, when you lookin' at me, ah, tell me what do you see? (
I love myself
)
Ah, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the poli' (
I love myself
)
Uh, illuminated by the hand of God, boy, don't seem shy (
I love myself
)
One day at a time, huh[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
They wanna say it's a war outside, bomb in the street
Gun in the hood, mob of police
Rock on the corner with a line for the fiend
And a bottle full of lean and a model on the scheme, uh
These days of frustration keep 
y'all on tuck and rotation
 (Come to the front)
Yeah, I duck these cold faces, post up fi-fie-fo-fum basis
Dreams of reality's peace (
Oh, yeah
)
Blow steam in the face of the beast
Sky could fall down, wind could cry now
Look at me, motherfucker, I smile
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
And I love my (
I love myself
)
Uh, and when you lookin' at me, ah, tell me what do you see? (
I love myself
)
Ah, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the poli' (
I love myself
)
Uh, illuminated—
All y'all come to the front, y'all come up to the front (
I love myself
)
Baby, what about you? Come on
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
(
Crazy, what you gon' do?
)
Lift up your head and keep movin' (
Keep movin'
), turn the mic up
(
Haunt you
)
Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart
On my sleeve, let the runway start
You know the miserable do love company
What do you want from me and my scars?
Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence
How many times my potential was anonymous?
How many times the city making me promises?
So I promise this, nigga[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I love myself
Uh, and when you lookin' at me, ah, tell me what do you see? (
I love myself

(I love myself) Huh (Fi-fie-fo-fum), huh (Fi-fie-fo-fum)
(I love myself) Huh (My heart undone), one, two, three
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I went to war last night
With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic
I'ma do it 'til I get it right (
Oh, no
)
I went to war last night (
Night, night, night, night, woo
)
I've been dealin' with depression ever since an adolescent
Duckin' every other blessin', I can never see the message
I could never take the lead, I could never bob and weave
From a negative and lettin' them annihilate me
And it's evident I'm movin' at a meteor speed
Finna run into a buildin', lay my body—
[Spoken Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
(*Offstage argument*)
Ayy, hold on, woah, woah, stop all this
Not on my, not while I'm up here
Not on my time, kill the music, not on my time
We could save that shit for the streets
We could save that shit, this for the kids, bro
2015, niggas tired of playin' victim, dog
Niggas ain't trying to play vic—, TuTu, how many niggas we done lost?
How many—, Yan-Yan, how many we lost?
No, for real, answer the que—, how many niggas we done lost, bro?
This—, this year alone
Exactly, so we—, we ain't got time to waste time, my nigga
Niggas gotta make time, bro
The judge make time, you know that, the judge make time, right?
The judge make time so it ain't shit
It shouldn't be shit for us to come out here and appreciate the little bit of life we got left, dog
On the dead homies, Charlie P, you know that, bro
You know that
Right, it's man—, it's mando, right, it's mando
And I s—, and I—, and I—, and I say this because I, I love you niggas, man
I love all my niggas, bro
Exac—, enough said, enough said
And we gon' get back to the show and move on, because that shit petty, my nigga
Mic check, mic check, mic check, mic check, mic check
We gon' do some acapella shit before we get back to, a—
All my niggas listen, listen to this
I promised Dave I'd never use the phrase ""fuck nigga""
He said, ""Think about what you saying: 'Fuck niggas'
No better than Samuel on the Django
No better than a white man with slave boats""
Sound like I needed some soul searching
My pops gave me some game in real person
Retraced my steps on what they never taught me
Did my homework fast before government caught me
So I'ma dedicate this one verse to Oprah
On how the infamous, sensitive N-word control us
So many artists gave her an explanation to hole us
Well, this is my explanation straight from Ethiopia
N-E-G-U-S definition: royalty; king royalty—wait, listen
N-E-G-U-S description: black emperor, king, ruler, now let me finish
The history books overlooked the word and hide it
America tried to make it to a house divided
The homies don't recognize we been usin' it wrong
So I'ma break it down and put my game in a song
N-E-G-U-S, say it with me, or say it no more
Black stars can come and get me
Take it from Oprah Winfrey, tell her she right on time
Kendrick Lamar, by far, realest Negus alive[Produced by Rahki]

The title of “A Nigga Witta Gun” is pretty self-explanatory. During the making of The Chronic, Dr. Dre drew some inspiration from the jazzy sounds of A Tribe Called Quest’s 1991 sophomore album The Low End…

Fuck that, nigga, what's up with all that shit you was talkin', nigga? (

You're a motherfuckin' liar, nigga, that was you (
Nah, that wasn't me

Who's the man with the master plan?
A nigga with a motherfuckin' gun
[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Forty-four reasons come to mind
Why a motherfuckin' brother is hard to find
He been walkin' on the streets and fuckin' with mine
Stupid punk can't fuck with a mastermind
See, I never take a step on a Compton block
Or L.A. without the AK ready to pop
'Cause them punk motherfuckers in black and white
Ain't the only motherfuckers I gots to fight
I think it's better to be tellin' the facts than cuffed up
And jacked and fucked up
What you niggas looking at? You going
""Goddamn,"" 'cause it's the city
And for you to survive, a nigga gotta be a gangsta
And I'm a nigga you can't remove
Took out a lot of motherfuckers for tryin' to prove
To they homies that they can hang by dealin' with me
But once again in the end they D-E-A-D
I never did time on a murder yet
'Cause I relax, sit back, do a job and jet
Yo, I know you understand my flow
So here we go, and Death Row
Come let a motherfucker know[Chorus: Snoop Dogg &

D-R-E, a motherfucker who's known for carryin' gats
And kick raps that make snaps, adapts to
Any environment that I'm located at
If you see me on the solo move believe that I'm strapped
Four-four, tray-eight or AK-47
'Cause slowly but surely send you on a stairway to heaven
Just put my finger on the trigger and pull back
And lay a punk motherfucker flat
As he wonder what popped before he got popped
I told you I was Dre and you know it don't stop
Now I know you understand my flow
So here we go, and Death Row
Come let a motherfucker know

I breaks 'em off, I breaks 'em off, yeah
I breaks 'em off, I breaks 'em off, yeah
[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
I breaks 'em off, but I ain't speaking about between the thighs
I'm talking about cocking a gauge in between your eyes
It'll make you drop to your knees 'cause you realize
That a gat'll make any nigga civilized
Old buster-ass nigga talking bullshit
Don't know that I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with
Get lit or hit up by the doctor
A nigga that breaks 'em off properly
Real G, so don't doubt it
I'm the one who's doin' it while these other niggas talk about it
And if motherfuckers come at me wrong
I straight put my forty-four Desert Eagle to his motherfuckin' dome
And show him why they call me the notorious one
The name is Dre Eastwood when I'm packing a gun
You don't believe me, well step up and give it a try
And if you die, you's a buster, 'cause real niggas don't die
But some still don't hear me, though
You're too near me not to hear me, nigga, yo
So now you know

Had another meeting, now my plan is to meet you
Got my hands out, all I wanna do is reach ya
All I wanna do is greet ya
Infatuated, sorry if I stare
Where you posted up? I wanna be there
Way you curved up, it just ain't fair
No, it ain't

[Verse 1]
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought I'd live to see it break
It's getting dark and it's all too quiet
And I can't trust anything now
And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake
[Pre-Chorus]
Woah, holding my breath
Won't lose you again
Something's made your eyes go cold
[Chorus]
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted
[Verse 2]
Stood there and watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time, I'm wishing he was you instead[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, holding my breath
Won't see you again
Something keeps me holding onto nothing
[Chorus]
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

I know, I know
I just know
You're not gone
You can't be gone, no

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
Won't finish what you started
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this

Can't breathe whenever you're gone
I can't go back, I'm haunted[Outro]

That's a really heartbreaking and tragic thing to go through, because the whole time you're trying to tell yourself it's not happening. I went through this, and I ended up waking up in the middle of the night writing this song about it.

I wanted the music and the orchestration to reflect the intensity of the emotion the song is about, so we recorded strings with Paul Buckmaster at Capitol Studios in Los Angeles. It was an amazing experience - recording this entire big, live string section that I think in the end really captured the intense, chaotic feeling of confusion I was looking for.""

[Verse 1]
Say you're sorry, that face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you
Holdin' on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known
[Chorus]
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now, it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around
[Verse 2]
Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now, I know
[Chorus]
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now, it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around[Bridge]
And there you are on your knees
Beggin' for forgiveness, beggin' for me
Just like I always wanted
But I'm so sorry
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
And it's too late for you and your white horse
Now, it's too late for you and your white horse
To catch me now

Big Machine Records released the track to US country radio on December 8, 2008. Swift wrote ""White Horse"" with Liz Rose and produced it with Nathan Chapman. An understated country pop ballad, the song is driven by a finger-picked guitar and includes piano and cello accents. The lyrics incorporate fairy-tale imagery of princesses and white horses—a narrator is heartbroken on realizing that her boyfriend is not an ideal figure like she thought, and in the end leaves her town with hopes of finding somebody more worthy.

Music critics lauded ""White Horse"" for what they deemed a somber production and a portrayal of universal feelings arising from heartbreak, but some found the lyrics uncreative. At the 2010 Grammy Awards, the track won Best Country Song and Best Female Country Vocal Performance. In the United States, the single peaked at number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number two on the Hot Country Songs chart, and the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified it double platinum. The song also charted in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom; it received certifications in the first two countries.

Trey Fanjoy directed the song's music video, which depicts Swift reliving memories with her ex-boyfriend after having ended their relationship through a phone call. The video premiered on February 7, 2009, on CMT, and it became the first video to debut at number one on the network's countdown. Swift performed ""White Horse"" live at the 2008 American Music Awards, on her Fearless Tour (2009–2010), and on select dates of her later tours. Following the 2019 dispute regarding the ownership of Swift's back catalog, she re-recorded the song as ""White Horse (Taylor's Version)"" for her 2021 re-recorded album Fearless (Taylor's Version).

According to a note published in the liner notes of Swift's 2019 album Lover, part of the lyrics to ""White Horse"" dated from December 2006. She wrote the first verse by herself; co-writer Liz Rose helped her complete the song in 45 minutes. Swift completed writing ""White Horse"" weeks after she finished the lead single ""Love Story"", almost one year before the release of Fearless. Swift said she was inspired to write ""White Horse"" by the moment she realized all the fantasies she had about a boy turned out completely false. The subject was also the inspiration for ""Love Story""—Swift never dated him and, although initially infatuated with him, realized he was not an ideal Prince Charming like she thought. She told The Daily Telegraph that she kept his identity anonymous so as to ""not glorify his inspirational qualities"". Whereas both ""Love Story"" and ""White Horse"" feature prominent fairy-tale lyrical imagery, Swift said it was important to regard fairy tales with ""both sides""; the former song represented her optimistic and idealistic viewpoint on romance, and the latter her disillusionment with the said notion.

Swift intended to leave ""White Horse"" off Fearless because she felt the album already had a fair share of sad songs. She changed the decision when the producers of Grey's Anatomy wanted to feature the song in the series. Swift recalled that at a meeting set up by her agency with the show's executive producers Shonda Rhimes and Betsy Beers, she played ""White Horse"" alone on guitar and they ""freaked out"". The song appeared on the premiere of season five, broadcast on September 25, 2008. Swift was elated by the feature and said it was her ""life goal"" to have her song on Grey's Anatomy, one of her favorite series.

""White Horse"" was released as an album cut on Fearless, on November 11, 2008, by Big Machine Records. On December 8, Big Machine released the song to US country radio as the second single from the album. In the United States, ""White Horse"" debuted and peaked at number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart week ending November 29, 2008. It gave Swift her sixth top-20 debut in 2008, which broke the record for the most top-20 debuts in a calendar year by an artist. On Hot Country Songs, the single peaked at number two on the chart week ending April 4, 2009. It was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2014 and had sold two million digital copies in the United States by 2017. The single also charted in Australia (41), Canada (43), and the United Kingdom (60). It was certified gold in the first two countries. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Swift/_/White+Horse"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

[Verse 1]
She was sittin' all alone over on the tailgate
Tan legs swingin' by a Georgia plate
I was lookin' for her boyfriend
Thinkin', ""no way, she ain't got one""
Soon as I sat down, I was fallin' in love
Tryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck
She jumped up and cut me off
[Chorus]
She was like, ""Oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is""
She was like, ""Come here, boy, I wanna dance""
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' me around 'til it faded out
And she gave me a kiss
And she said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""
And I said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""
[Verse 2]
I'da gave that DJ my last dime
If he would have played it just one more time
But a little while later
We were sittin' in the drive in my truck
Before I walked her to the door
I was scannin' like a fool; AM, FM, XM too
But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove
Man, you should have seen her light up[Chorus]
She was like, ""Oh my God, this is my song
We've been listenin' to the radio all night long
I can't believe that it came back on, but here it is""
She was like, ""Come here boy, I wanna dance""
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights, she gave me a goodnight kiss
And I said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""
And she said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""
[Bridge]
The next Friday night we were sittin' out under the stars
You should have seen her smile when I broke out my guitar
[Chorus]
She was like, ""Oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is""
She was like, ""Come here boy, I wanna dance""
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights, she gave me a goodnight kiss
And she said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""

Graduation Day Lyrics
“Graduation Day” dramatizes Kanye getting reprimanded and kicked out of college for getting kids to sing about drugs in “We Don’t Care.”
[Spoken: DeRay]
What in the fuck was that, Kanye?!
I told you to do some shit for the kids!
You can give me your muthafuckin' graduation ticket right now! You give me this muthafuckin' robe before you catch some senioritis!
You will not walk 'cross that stage, you won’t slide across that stage!
Motherfucker can’t pull you 'cross that muthafuckin' stage, Kanye!
Who told you? See, I told you to do somethin' uplifting!
I’m tryna get you out here with these white people and this how you're gon' do me?
You know what, you's a nigga, and I don’t mean that in no nice way
Had lil' kids sing about the shit—y'know, the joke's on you
You throw your motherfucking hands in the air and wave goodbye to every-motherfucking-body! 'Cause, you getting the fuck out of this campus!
What the fuck you gon' do now?
[Verse: John Legend]
I'm no longer confused, but, don't tell anybody
I'm about to break the rules, but, don't tell anybody

And it looks like the end of the rainbow ain't no pot of gold
The things that I've done

What She Wants Tonight Lyrics
[Verse 1]
She walks up, velvet rope unhooks
She snaps her fingers and a drink comes
She locks you down with just one look
She's got this whole club undone
If she's on the rebound, you ain't gonna know it
Coming off a heartbreak, she ain't gonna show it
She's eyes caught, red dot, locked on me, yeah
[Chorus]
She wants my hands on her body
She wants to burn like she's made of fire
Said she ain't going home 'til we
Drink every drop of Kentucky dry
Don't even know what she'll do when she does it
Palm of her hand, I'm hers in the blink of an eye
She don't take no and I love
She gets what she wants
And I get to be what she wants tonight
I get to be what she wants tonight
[Verse 2]
I get to catch all her secrets
Sequins bouncing off flashing lights
If she wants it, then we're leaving
Get me home, park the truck, cut the tires
I get to be where she goes when she's lonely
The last door of the night she's closing
Oh, I know she could have anything, but[Chorus]
She wants my hands on her body
She wants to burn like she's made of fire
Said she ain't going home 'til we
Drink every drop of Kentucky dry
Don't even know what she'll do when she does it
Palm of her hand, I'm hers in the blink of an eye
She don't take no and I love
She gets what she wants
And I get to be what she wants tonight
I get to be what she wants tonight
[Bridge]
And I don't know how I got to be
The only thing she needs right now, uh

She wants my hands on her body
She wants to burn like she's made of fire
Said she ain't going home 'til we
Drink every drop of Kentucky dry

Ah yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 1]
The moment when the light is red before the go
The moment when the curtain's down before the show
The moment when you're done, but maybe just one more
That's how I feel before I get you all alone
[Pre-Chorus]
We could give it a minute
But what's the fun in a minute?
When we could push all the limits
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Shirt hanging off my shoulders
Both hands wanna hold ya
So baby, what's the hold up?
Yeah, yeah

Can you feel the tension rising?
Now you're, now you're getting it close
Now you're, now you're getting it close

Speed this up 'cause I'm excited
No more, no more taking it slow
No more, no more taking it slow
Almost love, it's almost love[Post-Chorus]

It could be, yeah

I want you like a midnight hour wants a view
I want you like a loner wants an empty room
I want you like a kiss that's long and overdue
I need you more than I have ever needed you
[Pre-Chorus]
And we could give it a minute
But what's the fun in a minute?
When we could push all the limits
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Shirt hanging off my shoulders
Both hands wanna hold ya
So baby, what's the hold up?
Yeah[Chorus]
Can you feel the tension rising?
Now you're, now you're getting it close
Now you're, now you're getting it close
Almost love, it's almost love
Speed this up 'cause I'm excited
No more, no more taking it slow
No more, no more taking it slow
Almost love, it's almost love

Almost love
It's almost love, but it could be love
Almost love
Almost love, but it could be love
Almost lo-lo-lo-lo-love
Almost love, but it could be love
It could be love
It could be, yeah, oh no
[Bridge]
We could give it a minute
But what's the fun in a minute?
[Chorus]
Can you feel the tension rising?
Now you're getting it so close
Now you're getting this so close
Almost love, almost love
Oh, 'cause I'm excited
No more, no more taking it slow
No more, no more taking it slow
It's almost love[Post-Chorus]

On September 8, 2014, One Direction announced the release of their fourth album titled, Four, on the Today Show. The band members, along with the band's official account, then tweeted about “Fireproof“. On November 17, 2014 they announced new song “No Control“.

“No Control“ is a significant track for several reasons. It features Louis Tomlinson on primary lead vocal for the chorus, a first for him. Tomlinson co-wrote the song with Liam Payne. No Control features overtly sexual lyrics. Like many tracks on the FOUR album, its frank lyrical discussion of sex marks a clear transition into a more mature sound for the band. It is also notable for the global social media campaign it inspired.

On August 16, 2015, “No Control“ became the first non-single to ever win a Teen Choice Award.

In May 2015, fans worldwide began to promote “No Control“ online, as if it were an official single. The idea came about due to frustration with harsh words exchanged in an online fight between Louis Tomlinson, producer Naughty Boy and former One Direction member Zayn Malik. During the fight, Naughty Boy implied Louis was a subpar performer. Fans also felt the FOUR album was not receiving the public recognition or exposure it deserved, with only two singles released, and their current tour at the time barely featuring any songs from the album.

The online campaign was called #ProjectNoControl or #NoControlDay. Using social media, millions of people tweeted, texted and called radio stations all over the world. Radio responded positively and began playing the track within 24 hours of the campaign starting. In less than a week, “No Control“ had been played on over 60 stations worldwide, including BBC Radio 1 and Z100 New York. The song was also the top trending topic on Billboard's twitter chart, and, at one point, the entire Four album made the chart as well. Many media companies, such as MTV, showed their support in various ways. Several media publications wrote articles on the project and a Polish TV station reported it on their evening news show. Billboard added No Control to their annual ""Song of the Summer"" poll after it received thousands of votes, despite non-singles usually not being eligible for the list. The song reached #1 on iTunes in Sweden, Finland and Greece.

Louis Tomlinson spoke about the band's appreciation of the project on The Late Late Show with James Corden and commended the fanbase for unifying in such a short amount of time. Tomlinson also spoke again about the project at the 2015 Billboard Awards. Throughout the campaign, Tomlinson tweeted his support and thanks, and followed various radio DJs who played the song on Twitter.

“No Control“ was officially added to the On The Road Again Tour setlist on June 13, 2015, in Brussels, Belgium. Louis regularly thanked fans before each performance of the song, for their participation in Project No Control.

During one concert, Liam told the crowd the song was one of the last they finished writing for FOUR, and was the most difficult song to complete.

The song was performed during One Direction's Summer Concert Series for Good Morning America on August 4, 2015, in New York. It aired a few months later, with the words ""loaded gun"" censored. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/One+Direction/_/No+Control"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

You gon' be strong enough to take this shit

Then I went back and got that six

I call it the milk truck and shit
I'll have your ho eyeballin' at the light, damn pimpin'
You should take time to check that bitch
Find me ridin' through the hood actin' like it's all good
But I'm looking for a jux and shit
In the middle of the night, you can turn on the light
Find me and my niggas in yo' crib
Nigga holla if there's a problem and yo' niggas got drama

Got them MAC's, got them 9's, got them techs full of dime

[Verse 1]
Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
'Til the gravity's too much
And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk away
But you're quicksand
[Chorus]
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I-I-I like it
[Verse 2]
I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
And all we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But you're friction[Chorus]
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
I, I, I like it
[Bridge]
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I would follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
[Chorus]
This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
I-I-I, I-I-I, I-I-I

Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know

I'll follow you, follow you home

And when you lied, said you didn't want me
Tell me, what was I supposed to do?

[Verse 1]
Come out, Virginia, don't let me wait
You Catholic girls start much too late
Aww, but sooner or later, it comes down to fate
I might as well be the one
Well, they showed you a statue, told you to pray
They built you a temple and locked you away
Aww, but they never told you the price that you pay
For things that you might have done
[Chorus]
Well, only the good die young
That's what I said
Only the good die young
Only the good die young
[Verse 2]
You mighta heard I run with a dangerous crowd
We ain't too pretty, we ain't too proud
We might be laughing a bit too loud
Aww, but that never hurt no one
So come on, Virginia, show me a sign
Send up a signal, I'll throw you the line
The stained glass curtain you're hidin' behind
Never lets in the sun
[Chorus]
Darlin', only the good die young
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
I tell ya, only the good die young
Only the good die young

You got a nice white dress and a party on your confirmation
You got a brand new soul
Mmm, and a cross of gold
But Virginia, they didn't give you quite enough information
You didn't count on me
When you were counting on your rosary
Oh woah woah
[Verse 3]
And they say there's a heaven for those who will wait
And some say it's better, but I say it ain't
I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints
The sinners are much more fun
[Chorus]
You know that only the good die young
Oh-oh-ho, baby
I tell ya, only the good die young
Only the good die young[Saxophone Solo]
[Bridge]
You said your mother told you, ""All that I could give you was a reputation""
Aww, she never cared for me
But did she ever say a prayer for me?
Oh woah woah
[Verse 4]
Well, come out, come out, come out, Virginia, don't let me wait
You Catholic girls start much too late
But sooner or later, it comes down to fate
I might as well be the one
[Chorus]
You know that only the good die young
Tell you, baby
You know that only the good die young
Only the good die young
Only the good
Only the good die young

The song was inspired by a high school crush of Joel's, Virginia Callahan. The boy/narrator believes that the girl is refusing him because she comes from a religious Catholic family and that she believes premarital sex is sinful.

Attempts to censor the song only made it more popular, after religious groups considered it anti-Catholic, and pressured radio stations to remove it from their playlists.

""When I wrote 'Only the Good Die Young', the point of the song wasn't so much anti-Catholic as pro-lust,"" Joel told Performing Songwriter magazine. ""The minute they banned it, the album started shooting up the charts."" 

In a 2008 interview, Joel also pointed out one part of the lyrics that virtually all the song's critics missed – the boy in the song failed to get anywhere with the girl, and she kept her chastity.

The song begins with a piano introduction and builds in intensity with Joel's high tempo vocals. Billboard Magazine described ""Only the Good Die Young"" as one of Joel's ""strongest and catchiest"" songs. Cash Box said that ""Billy grabs the fun with a rollicking, handclapping beat, raspy sax solo and racy piano licks.""

A demo, included in the box set ""My Lives"", is a slower, reggae version of the song. Joel reprised the song's motif in this version with a church organ. Joel has stated publicly that he changed the reggae beat to a shuffle beat at the request of his long time drummer, Liberty DeVitto, who hated reggae music. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Billy+Joel/_/Only+the+Good+Die+Young"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

[Chorus]
I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P
I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P (Now, shawty)
[Verse 1]
Now, shawty, she in the club, she dancin' for dollars
She got a thing for that Gucci, that Fendi, that Prada
That BCBG, Burberry, Dolce & Gabbana
She feed them foolish fantasies, they pay her 'cause they want her
I spit a little G, man, and my game got her
An hour later, have that ass up in the Ramada
Them trick niggas in her ear sayin' they think about her
I got the bitch by the bar, tryna get a drink up out her
She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk
She from the country, think she like me 'cause I'm from New York
I ain't that nigga tryna holler 'cause I want some head
I'm that nigga tryna holler 'cause I want some bread
I could care less how she perform when she in the bed
Bitch, hit that track, catch a date, and come and pay the kid
Look, baby, this is simple, you can't see
You fuckin' with me, you fuckin' with a P-I-M-P[Chorus]
I don't know what you heard about me (Woo)

[Bridge]
I'm 'bout my money, you see, girl, you can holler at me
If you fuckin' with me, I'm a P-I-M-P
Not what you see on TV, no Cadillac, no greasy
Head full of hair, bitch, I'm a P-I-M-P
Come get money with me if you curious to see
How it feels to be with a P-I-M-P
Roll in the Benz with me, you could watch some TV
From the backseat of my V, I'm a P-I-M-P
[Verse 2]
Girl, we could pop some champagne and we could have a ball
We could toast to the good life, girl, we could have it all
We could really splurge, girl, and tear up the mall
If ever you needed someone, I'm the one you should call
I'll be there to pick you up if ever you should fall
If you got problems, I can solve 'em, they big or they small
That other nigga you be with ain't 'bout shit
I'm your friend, your father, and confidant, bitch[Chorus]
I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see

No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P (Now, shawty)
[Verse 3]
I told you fools before, I stay with the tools
I keep a Benz, some rims, and some jewels
I holler at a ho 'til I got a bitch confused
She got on Payless, me? I got on gator shoes
I'm shoppin' for chinchillas, in the summer they cheaper
Man, this ho, you can have her when I'm done, I ain't gon' keep her
Man, bitches come and go, every nigga pimpin' know
This ain't no secret, you ain't gotta keep it on the low
Bitch, choose on me, I'll have you strippin' in the street
Put my other hoes down, you get your ass beat
Now Niki my bottom bitch, she always come up with my bread
The last nigga she was with put stitches in her head
Get your ho out of pocket, I'll put a charge on a bitch
'Cause I need four TVs and AMGs for the six
Ho, make a pimp rich, I ain't payin', bitch
Catch a date, suck a dick, shit (Trick)[Chorus]
I don't know what you heard about me (Yeah)
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me (Woo)
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see (Uh-huh)
That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P
I don't know what you heard about me (Uh-huh)
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me (Yeah)
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P

In Hollywood they say, ""There's no business like show business""

[Verse 1]
Slow down, you crazy child
You're so ambitious for a juvenile
But then if you're so smart
Tell me why are you still so afraid? Mm
Where's the fire, what's the hurry about?
You'd better cool it off before you burn it out
You've got so much to do
And only so many hours in a day, hey
[Chorus]
But you know that when the truth is told
That you can get what you want or you can just get old
You're gonna kick off before you even get halfway through, ooh
When will you realize Vienna waits for you?
[Verse 2]
Slow down, you're doin' fine
You can't be everything you wanna be before your time
Although it's so romantic on the borderline tonight, tonight
Too bad, but it's the life you lead
You're so ahead of yourself, that you forgot what you need
Though you can see when you're wrong
You know you can't always see when you're right
You're right[Chorus]
You've got your passion, you've got your pride
But don't you know that only fools are satisfied?
Dream on, but don't imagine they'll all come true
, ooh
When will you realize Vienna waits for you?
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
Slow down, you crazy child
And take the phone off the hook and disappear for a while
It's all right, you can afford to lose a day or two, ooh
When will you realize Vienna waits for you?
[Outro]
And you know that when the truth is told
That you can get what you want or you could just get old
You're gonna kick off before you even get halfway through, ooh

""Why did I pick Vienna to use as a metaphor for the rest of your life? My father lives in Vienna now. I had to track him down. I didn't see him from the time I was 8 'till I was about 23-24 years old. He lives in Vienna, Austria which I thought was rather bizarre because he left Germany in the first place because of this guy named Hitler and he ends up going to the same place that Hitler hung out all those years! Vienna, for a long time was the crossroads. During the Cold War, between the Eastern Bloc, the Warsaw Pact nations and the NATO countries was the city of Vienna... Vienna was always the crossroads - between the Ottoman Empire and the Holy Roman Empire. So the metaphor of Vienna has the meaning of a crossroad. It's a place of inter...course, of exchange - it's the place where cultures co-mingle. You get great beer in Vienna but you also get brandy from Armenia. It was a place where cultures co-mingled.

So I go to visit my father in Vienna, I'm walking around this town and I see this old lady. She must have been about 90 years old and she is sweeping the street. I say to my father ""What's this nice old lady doing sweeping the street?"" He says ""She's got a job, she feels useful, she's happy, she's making the street clean, she's not put out to pasture"". We treat old people in this country pretty badly. We put them in rest homes, we kinda kick them under the rug and make believe they don't exist. They [the people in Vienna] don't feel like that. In a lot of these older places in the world, they value their older people and their older people feel they can still be a part of the community and I thought 'This is a terrific idea - that old people are useful -and that means I don't have to worry so much about getting old because I can still have a use in this world in my old age. I thought ""Vienna waits for you...""

There is also a lot of inside stuff on the song. The beginning and the end is very Kurt Weill. That kind of sick, middle-European, kinky decadent thing.. cabaret kinda.... there's a lot of crazy stuff going on. We are seeing the result of it in this ethnic warfare in the Balkans which is a tragedy. This century started out with this Assassination of the Archduke in Sarajevo and that began World War I which began the Russian Revolution, then you had the Depression then that began World War II and then that began the Cold War and all that's over but they're still blowing each other to smithereens in Sarajevo. So this whole thing is going on in middle Europe - it's Kurt Weill. And some composers, Dvořák, Smetana - they captured it.""  -- Billy Joel, An Evening of Questions & Answers and Perhaps a Few Songs

 It was played in a 1981 episode of Taxi called ""Vienna Waits."" Marilu Henner's character Elaine Nardo refers to the song while on vacation in Europe with Alex Reiger, played by Judd Hirsch. The song can also be found on the soundtrack of ""13 Going on 30"". <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Billy+Joel/_/Vienna"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Midnight and the moon is out
Careful, you might hurt yourself
Pleasure leads to pain
To me, they're both the same
Sweat drippin' down to the floor
Bite marks like an animal
You might be insane
But maybe we're the same

Tonight you came here
'Cause you know what I need
And no one likes to be alone

Baby, you were the love of my life, woah
Maybe you don't know what's lost till you find it
[Verse 1]
Take a walk on Sunday through the afternoon
We can always find somethin' for us to do
We don't really like what's on the news, but it's on all the time
I take you with me every time I go away
In a hotel, usin' someone else's name
I remember back at Jonny's place, it's not the same anymore

Baby, you were the love of my life, woah
Maybe you don't know what's lost till you find it
It's not what I wantеd, to leave you behind
Don't know whеre you'll land when you fly
But, ​baby, you were the love of my life
[Post-Chorus]
It's unfortunate (Ooh)
Just coordinates (Ooh)
[Verse 2]
I don't know you half as well as all my friends
I won't pretend that I've been doin' everything I can
To get to know your creases and your ends
Are they the same?[Chorus]
​Baby, you were the love of my life, woah
Maybe you don't know what's lost till you find it
It's not what I wanted, to leave you behind
Don't know where you'll land when you fly
But, ​baby, you were the love of my life

In this song, Harry sings about falling out of a relationship with someone just to realize after that this person was the love of his life. It was them. It has always been them. It has been them all along.

""“Love of My Life” was the most terrifying song because it’s so bare. It’s so sparse.

""“Love of My Life” was the most terrifying song because it’s so bare. It’s so sparse. It’s also very much in the spirit of what Harry’s House is about: I wanted to make an acoustic EP, all in my house, and make it really intimate. It’s named after the Japanese pop pioneer [Haruomi] Hosono, who had an album in the ‘70s called Hosono House. I immediately started thinking about what Harry’s House might look like. It took time for me to realise that the house wasn’t a geographical location, it was an internal thing. When I applied that concept to the songs we were making here, everything took on new meaning. Imagine it’s a day in my house or a day in my mind. What do I go through? I’m playing fun music. I’m playing sad music. I’m playing this, I’m playing that. I have doubts. I’m feeling stuff. And it’s all mine. This is my favourite album at the moment. I love it so much. And because of the circumstances, it was made very intimately; everything was played by a small number of people and made in a room. To me, it’s everything. It’s everything I’ve wanted to make.""

[Verse 1]
I took a chance, I took a shot
And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not
You took a swing, I took it hard
And down here from the ground, I see who you are
[Chorus]
I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you love me, then cut me down
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
That makes me run for cover when you're around
And here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why
[Verse 2]
You could write a book on how to ruin someone's perfect day
Well, I get so confused and frustrated
Forget what I'm trying to say, oh
[Chorus]
I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I got no one to believe in
You tell me that you want me, then push me around
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
That makes me run for cover when you're around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why[Bridge]
Why do you have to make me feel small
So you can feel whole inside?
Why do you have to put down my dreams
So you're the only thing on my mind?
[Chorus]
I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you want me, then cut me down
I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I've got no one to believe in
You ask me for my love, then you push me around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why (Why)
Tell me why (Why)

You make me smile with my heart, oh
[Chorus: Kanye West &

Why everything that's supposed to be bad make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man, I tried to stop, man, I tried the best I could
But 
you make me smile
[Verse 1: Kanye West & 
Etta James

What's your addiction? Is it money? Is it girls? Is it weed?
I've been afflicted by not one, not two, but all three
She's got the same thing, about me, but more, about us
She's coming over, so I guess, that means, I'm her drugs
(
You make me smile
)
Just let me peek now, I mean, damn, I'm so curious
She's got a lover, so the lies, and the lust, is a rush
Time's of the essence, I need you to be spontaneous
Roll up the doja, Henny and Co-Co-Coca-Cola
(
You make me smile with my heart, ohh
)
Then I'm co-coming over 'cause it's ne-never over

Etta James

I see the emotion in your eyes, that you try not to show
We get the closest when you high, or you drunk, or you blown
So I pour the potion, so we could both get high, as we could go
Then I'll get the lotion, and do somethin' to me, when your thighs is exposed
 
(
You make me smile
)
There's no turning back now, I mean I don't mean to impose
Not now but right now, I need you to undress, and then pose
I'm into that now, catch a vibe when the doors get closed
Roll up the doja, Henny and Co-Co-Coca Cola
(
You make me smile with my heart
)
And I keep co-coming over 'cause it's ne-never over

I just wanted to ask you
Just wanted to um, let me, how would I put this, uhh
Let's say, all your friends, remember the one
You said, if you ever, she would be the one
Okay, okay, okay
 
(
You make me smile with my heart
)
Well, I was thinking, hypothetically
I mean, don't take this seriously
Don't take me, I mean, just, uhh, not credibly
I'm feeling incredibly, I mean, let's let it be
I just let it be
I mean you, her and me

Good morning, good morning
Good morning, good morning
Good morning
[Verse 1: John Lennon]
Nothing to do to save his life, call his wife in
Nothing to say but what a day, how's your boy been?
Nothing to do, it's up to you
I've got nothing to say but it's okay
[Chorus: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Good morning, good morning
Good morning
[Verse 2: John Lennon]
Going to work, don't want to go, feeling low down
Heading for home, you start to roam, then you're in town
[Bridge: John Lennon]
Everybody knows there's nothing doing
Everything is closed, it's like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep
And you're on your own, you're in the street[Verse 3: John Lennon]
After a while, you start to smile, now you feel cool
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school
Nothing has changed, it's still the same
I've got nothing to say but it's okay
[Chorus: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Good morning, good morning
Good morning
[Guitar Solo: George Harrison]
[Bridge: John Lennon]
People running round, it's five o'clock
Everywhere in town, it's getting dark
Everyone you see is full of life
It's time for tea and Meet the Wife
[Verse 4: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Somebody needs to know the time, glad that I'm here
Watching the skirts, you start to flirt, now you're in gear
Go to a show, you hope she goes
I've got nothing to say, but it's okay

When I got the news today
I didn't know what to say
So I just hung up the phone
I took a walk to clear my head
This is where the walking lead
Can't believe you're really gone
Don't feel like going home
[Chorus]
So I'm gonna sit right here
On the edge of this pier
Watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer
[Verse 2]
Funny how the good ones go
Too soon, but the good Lord knows
The reasons why, I guess
Sometimes the greater plan
Is kinda hard to understand
Right now it don't make sense
I can't make it all make sense

So I'm gonna sit right here

Watch the sunset disappear

Hoo-ooh
Ohh-ohh
Mmm-mmm
[Verse 1]
Anthony works in the grocery store
Savin' his pennies for someday
Mama Leone left a note on the door
She said, ""Sonny, move out to the country""
Ah but workin' too hard can give you a heart attack
Ack-ack-ack-ack-ack
[Pre-Chorus]
You oughta know by now
(You oughta know by now)
Who needs a house out in Hackensack
Is that all you get for your money?

And it seems such a waste of time
If that's what it's all about
Mama, if that's movin' up then I'm movin' out
I'm movin' out, mmm mm
Ooh-ooh, uh-huh, mmm[Verse 2]
Sergeant O'Leary is walkin' the beat
At night he becomes a bartender
He works at Mr. Cacciatore's
Down on Sullivan Street
Across from the medical center
Yeah, and he's tradin' in his Chevy
For a Cadillac-ac-ac-ac-ac-ac
[Pre-Chorus]
You oughta know by now
(You oughta know by now)
And if he can't drive with a broken back
At least he can polish the fenders
[Chorus]
And it seems such a waste of time
If that's what it's all about
Mama, if that's movin' up then I'm movin' out
Mmm, I'm movin' out
Oh-ohh, ooh ooh, uh-huh, mmm
[Verse 3]
You should never argue
With a crazy mind-mind-mind-mind-mind-mind
[Pre-Chorus]
You oughta know by now
(You oughta know by now)
You can pay Uncle Sam with the overtime
Is that all you get for your money?

And if that's what you have in mind
Yeah, if that's what you're all about
Good luck movin' up, 'cause I'm movin' out

[Verse 1]
If you search for tenderness
It isn't hard to find
You can have the love you need to live
But if you look for truthfulness
You might just as well be blind
It always seems to be so hard to give
[Chorus]
""Honesty"" is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you
[Verse 2]
I can always find someone
To say they sympathize
If I wear my heart out on my sleeve
But I don't want some pretty face
To tell me pretty lies
All I want is someone to believe
[Chorus]
""Honesty"" is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you[Bridge]
I can find a lover, I can find a friend
I can have security until the bitter end
Anyone can comfort me with promises again
I know, I know, I know
[Verse 3]
When I'm deep inside of me
Don't be too concerned
I won't ask for nothin' while I'm gone
But when I want sincerity
Tell me, where else can I turn?
'Cause you're the one that I depend upon
[Chorus]

David Spinozza plays the acoustic guitar in the song, Liberty DeVitto plays the drums and Robert Freedman the horn and string orchestration.

""Honesty"" is a piano ballad with synthesizer embellishments. It opens with ""sad and tender"" piano chords. According to Ken Bielen in his book The Words and Music of Billy Joel, Liberty DeVitto's drums and cymbal crashes, remind listeners that ""the track is a predecessor of the power ballads of the 1980s and 1990s"". It talks about the inherent lack of honesty even in the closest of relationships. In the song Joel sings the lines ""Honesty is such a lonely word"". Joel further sings about wearing his heart on his sleeve in ""Honesty"". According to Chuck Klosterman of The New York Times, ""[the song] implies that the only way you can tell that someone really cares about you is if they tell you you're bad."" ""Leningrad"", a song from Joel's eleventh studio album Storm Front, has been compared to ""Honesty"". According to the sheet music published on the website Musicnotes.com by Faber Music, ""Honesty"" is a pop rock and classical rock song written in the key of B♭ major. The song is set in common time and performed in a slow tempo of 80 beats per minute. Joel's vocals range from the note of Bb3 to A4. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Billy+Joel/_/Honesty"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The Devil Named Music Lyrics
[Verse 1]
We drove all night to Billings, Montana
Flew into Utah and slept there all day
And I can't remember stopping in Denver
Yeah, I live my illusion that somebody needs me to play
[Chorus]
And sometimes I'm drunk
And sometimes I'm stoned
And, yes, I get tired of being alone
And I miss my son
And I miss my wife
But the devil named music is taking my life
[Verse 2]
Now I sold my soul a long time ago
I put it in six strings and a sad melody
And I'm sometimes a winner, most times a loser
But if the crowd gets into it, it'll all feel the same way to me
[Chorus]
And sometimes I'm drunk
And sometimes I'm stoned
And, yes, I get tired of being alone
And I miss my daughter
And I miss my wife
But the devil named music is taking my life[Instrumental Break]

And sometimes I'm drunk
And sometimes I'm stoned
And, yes, I get tired of being alone
And I miss my son
And I miss my wife
But the devil named music is taking my life

And sometimes I'm stoned
Yes, I get tired of being alone
And I miss my daughter
And I miss my wife

Oh!
Oh, yeah

Hey you, don't wanna love you on the telephone
You're hanging up and I am all alone
Baby, you got me doin' dirt, doin' dirt, doin' dirt
And now, I wanna find you, but you're on the run
My heart's exploding like a burning sun
I know you like it when it hurts, when it hurts, when it hurts
[Chorus]
Hold me, we're dancing in the dark of the night
You're shining like a neon light
I light you up when I get inside
So won't you touch me?
'Cause everybody's watching us now
We're putting on a show for the crowd
So turn it up, baby, make it loud
[Verse 2]
Hey you, say that you're only havin' fun, and then
You call me up at 3 AM again
Baby, you got me doin' dirt, doin' dirt, doin' dirt
And now (Now) all that I got is just a microphone
To let you know that I am all alone
I know you like it when it hurts, when it hurts, when it hurts (Oh)[Chorus]

I wanna be with you all night, get in the car and let's go
Yeah, let's take it home, let's take it home, let's take it home

I wanna be with you all night, get in the car and let's go

[Verse 1]
The best song wasn't the single, but you weren't either
Livin' in Ladera Heights, the black Beverly Hills
Domesticated paradise, palm trees and pools
The water's blue, swallow the pill
Keepin' it surreal, whatever you like
Whatever feels good, whatever takes your mountain high
Keepin' it surreal, not sugar-free
My TV ain't HD, that's too real
Grape vine, mango, peaches, and lime
[Pre-Chorus]
A sweet life, a sweet life, sweet life
Sweet life, sweet life
A sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet life
A sweet life, a sweet life, sweetie pie
[Chorus]
You've had a landscaper and a housekeeper since you were born
The starshine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach?
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach
The sweet life
[Verse 2]
The best song wasn't the single, but you couldn't turn your radio down
Satellite need a receiver, can't seem to turn the signal fully off
Transmittin' the waves
You're catchin' that breeze 'til you're dead in the grave
But you're keepin' it surreal, whatever you like
Whatever feels good, whatever takes your mountain high
Keepin' it surreal,
 
not sugar-free
My TV ain't HD, that's too real
Grape vines, mango, peaches, and lime[Pre-Chorus]
A sweet life, a sweet life
A sweet life, yeah
A sweet life, a sweet life

live and die in the life

You've had a landscaper and a housekeeper since you were born (Yeah)
The starshine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach?
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach
[Bridge]
And the water is exactly what I wanted
It's everything I thought it'd be (Thought it'd be)
But this neighborhood is gettin' trippier every day
The neighborhood is goin' ape shit crazy, aah

Yo, yo, what's up?
Yo, man, give me some of that old, gangsta-ass shit, you know what I'm sayin'?
Some shit I can just kick back, smoke a fat-ass joint to
You know what I'm saying? Haha
Hell yeah, you know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
I like that old gangsta shit
'Cause you know it's a lot of niggas out there
Woofin' all that bullshit, talkin' 'bout they got this and got that
Talkin' louder than a motherfucker but ain't sayin' shit
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah, nigga, I see your lips quivering
But you ain't sayin' a motherfucking thing
But my niggas, I got my niggas in the motherfuckin' house
And they gon' tell you what's really going on
Got my motherfuckin' nigga RBX definitely in this motherfucker
I got my nigga Daz in this motherfucker, ready to kick some real shit
Know what I'm saying?
And that little shit you hear in the background?
That's my homegirl Rage
So, RBX, kick this shit
[Verse: RBX]
Seven execution style murders
I have no remorse 'cause I'm the fuckin' murderer
Haven't you ever heard of a killer?
I drop bombs like Hiroshima
So now I walk around strapped
One-time bust they caps and watch niggas collapse
Snap, adapt to this, but you need no adapter
This is just the first chapter
In a book from a crook
You get caught slippin', your ass gots to die
Nigga, tell me what the fuck you figure
Trigger happy, RBX to cap you
Pump, pump, and I can't wait to bust a round
Pump, pump, my hollow point smacks the clown
'Cause what I said split his head
And now they got me running from the feds
But I refuse to go alive
It's kill or be killed, that's how real niggas survive
I'm high powered[Outro: Dat Nigga Daz]
Yeah
It's Daz, that mass-murdering motherfucker
So, what, you feel like you wanna get caught up?
Fool, you better recognize
Death Row came to chastise
So if you cross the Row
Remember the first name is Death
No love for the other side",https://genius.com/Dr-dre-high-powered-lyrics,"",""

It's still Dre Day nigga,
 AK nigga
Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
'Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How? Nigga, my last album was 
The Chronic
 (
Nigga
)
They wanna know if he still got it
They say rap's changed, they wanna know how I feel about it

If you ain't up on thangs
)
Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my game
Still puffin' my leaves, still fuck with the beats
Still not lovin' police (
Huh-uh
)
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease (
For sho'

Still got love for the streets, reppin' 213 (
For life

Still the beats bang, still doin' my thang
Since I left ain't too much changed, still[Chorus: Snoop Dogg &

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dippin' again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doin' fifty a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat rap like Cali weed: I smoke 'til I'm 'sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire 'til you're soakin' in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
Since ""Turn Out the Lights"" from the World Class Wreckin Cru
I'm still at it, after mathematics
In the home of drive-bys and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
I dip through, then I give you (Still) D.R.E

Dr. Dre

Whether you're coolin' on the corner wit' your fly bitch (

Laidback in the shack, play this track
I'm representin' for the gangstas all across the world

Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl

I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap
Niggas try to be the king, but the ace is back
(
So if you ain't up on thangs
)
Dr. Dre be the name (
What?
), still runnin' the game
Still got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't trippin', love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more livin' hard (
Nah, nah
)
Barbeques every day, drivin' fancy cars (
Hey, hey

Still gon' get mine regardless (Still)[Chorus: Snoop Dogg (& Dr. Dre)]

The song is featured in the crime, drama, and thriller Training Day (2001), in the in-game radio station, West Coast Classics, in the video game Grand Theft Auto V (along with ""The Next Episode""), and was also featured on the American drama series Prison Break.

Background
Dr. Dre released his highly acclaimed debut solo album The Chronic in 1992. After this, Dre went seven years without releasing an album. During this time he featured on the Billboard Hot 100 chart-toppers ""California Love"" and ""No Diggity"", while also producing Snoop Dogg and Eminem's debut studio albums Doggystyle and The Slim Shady LP, respectively. The stakes were higher for the sequel to The Chronic, so Dre recruited Jay-Z to ghostwrite lyrics for the former's comeback single, ""Still D.R.E."". ""At first, he wrote about diamonds and Bentleys,"" Dre told Blaze magazine in 1999. ""So I told Jay to write some other shit. Jigga sat for 20 minutes and came back with some hard-ass, around-the-way L.A. shit."" In an interview on The Breakfast Club, Snoop Dogg elaborated on Jay-Z's contributions on the song. ""He wrote Dre’s shit and my shit and it was flawless,"" he said. ""It was 'Still D.R.E.' and it was Jay-Z and he wrote the whole fucking song.""

Music video
The music video, directed by Hype Williams, consists mainly of The D.O.C., Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre driving and riding in lowrider cars (a reference to the ""Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang"" music video from The Chronic album). It features several cameos: Eminem chasing a group of women across a beach, Xzibit driving a lowrider, Funkmaster Flex with Dr. Dre, and Warren G riding with several women. In the background the individual throwing up the W with the crowd next to Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre right next to the lowrider car was Coldhard from the Chicago based rap group Crucial Conflict. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Dr.+Dre/_/Still+D.R.E."">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

II HANDS II HEAVEN Lyrics
[Part I]
[Chorus]
Bottle in my hand, the whiskey up high
Two hands to Heaven, wild horses run wild, oh
God only knows why, though (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Rhinestones and diamonds both shine in the light
Two hands to Heaven, my whiskey up high, oh (Oh)
God only, God only knows why, though (Oh, oh, oh)
[Verse 1]
In the Arizona heat, summer fling saw your best side
Slip into my dreams every night, be the good guy
Who am I to judge, my baby? (Uh-uh)
Who am I to love, my baby? (Uh-uh)
Purple-colored mink, sugarcane
Hittin' them sixteen switches
Candy apple green, 
candy paint
Swirling twenty-four inch spinners (Swirl)
Don't judge me, baby (Ha)
You would never judge me, baby
[Chorus]
Bottle in my hand, my whiskey up high
Two hands to Heaven, coyotes run wild, oh (Oh, oh)
God only, God only knows why, though (Why? Why? Why?)
Ten thousand steps towards the time of your life
Two hands to Heaven, my whiskey up high, oh (Oh)
God only, God only knows why, though
Why, though? Why, though?[Post-Chorus]
Two hands to Heaven I've prayed, priest forgive my soul
Lovely daggers pierced my heart many moons ago
Toxic roses chased by wolves and carnivores
Lost virgins with broken wings that will regrow
[Verse 2]
I'm a stallion runnin', no candle in the wind
You won't ever see me comin' or goin' but you'll know whenever I'm here
Dancin' in the moonlight, catchin' every breeze
My feet on the dashboard, now go really fast, boy
Ever since I went to Marfa, ain't no trouble on my mind (On my mind, on my mind)
Singin' sweet songs to Las Vegas, singin', ""I will carry on""
Carry on, carry on, carry on, carry on
Singin', ""I will carry on""
[Chorus]
Ten thousand steps towards the time of your life
Two hands to Heaven, my whiskey up high, oh (Oh, oh)
God only, God only knows why, though (Why, though? Why?)
Rhinestones and diamonds both shine in the light
Two hands to Heaven, coyotes run wild, oh
God only, God only knows why, though (God only, God only knows why, though)
[Post-Chorus]
Two hands to Heaven I've prayed, priest forgive my soul
Lovely daggers pierced my heart many moons ago
Toxic roses chased by wolves and carnivores
Lost virgins with broken wings that will regrow[Part II]
[Segue]
Swirl
Baby, I've been waitin' my whole life
For you and I
[Verse]
This the real you, huh
This the real me, huh
They can't do nothin' but envy, ooh
Bliss, please (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Your love run through me like lava
Pull my fit over these hips
You grip, I grind
Then taste this wine, I'ma taste what's mine
'Cause I'ma take what's mine
Wonder whatever, wherever's fine
Like water, ah
Wherever you wanna go, that's fine with me
I'll never stop you, you'll never stop me
From bein' whatever we need to be
And in these dark times, I'm so glad that this love is blinding
'Cause all I see is the best of you, and all you see is the best of me
And you bring out the best of me
And all I see is everything
Your goals, your glow, your inner being
And our bigger meaning
So, let's lose us in these sheets (Yeah)
And when I get up to walk, I wanna feel weak, yeah
Look, I ain't goin' far (Ain't goin' far)
So, stay where you are (Stay where you are)
Feel like you partied in Venus and we woke up in Mars (Baby)
Yeah, I've been waitin' my whole life (Woo)
(I've been waitin' my whole life)
I'm gonna give you the best years of your life (For you, and I)

Ring on my Ears (English Ver.) Lyrics
[Verse 1: CyA]
Just until my 
earrings hit my face
I must run tons more than anyone else
My pick will never lose its shape, mm
Just until my earrings touch my cheeks
It means the green lights are on, got a pay
My pick will never lose its shape, mm
Yeah
The five piercings shining on there
Even though I'm sweaty but shawty
Same goes for you looking at me
The piercings color is rari
My pick will never lose its shape, mm
[Pre-Chorus: Dongmyeong]
Page one, so bright it looks like the moon
Page two, that's the key, I'm gonna hang on еars
Page three, grab the chain and go up, high up

Page three, grab the chain and go up, high up
Page four, I'll grab the longer chain, then keep on going up so high

When my cheeks are red, I'll get the ring all wet every day
[Verse 2: Yonghoon, 
Dongmyeong

Just until my earrings hit my face
Gain the strength to get back again, stand, yeah
So that I will never fall again, yeah
Just until my earrings hit my face
Even it's a bit heavy, it's okay
That's my faded earring, two concept, two concept
The wounds hurting you for so long will be healed
Until the time it breaks I'll forever sing for you
(Mm-mm, mm-mm) Everything is glimmering
(Mm-mm, mm-mm) Other thoughts are all erased
[Pre-Chorus: Dongmyeong]

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Don't take the chance because you think you can
[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
You’re beautiful, beyond compare
Takes more than beauty and seductive stares
To come between a family and a happy man
Jolene, I'm a woman too
Thе games you play are nothing new
So you don't want no hеat with me, Jolene
We've been deep in love for twenty years
I raised that man, I raised his kids
I know my man better than he knows himself (Yeah, what?)
I can easily understand
Why you're attracted to my man
But you don't want this smoke, so shoot your shot with someone else (You heard me)
[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm warnin' you, woman, find you your own man
Jolene, I know I’m a queen, Jolene
I’m still a Creole banjee bitch from Louisiane (Don't try me)[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
There’s a thousand girls in every room
That act as desperate as you do
You a bird, go on and sing your tune, Jolene (What?)
I had to have this talk with you
'Cause I hate to have to act a fool
Your peace depends on how you move, Jolene
[Bridge: Beyoncé & 
Choir

Me and my man crossed those valleys
Highs and lows and everything between
Good deeds roll in like tumblin' weeds
I sleep good, happy
'Cause you can’t dig up our planted seeds
I know my man's gon' stand by me, breathin' in my gentle breeze
I crossed those valleys
Highs and lows and everything between
Good deeds roll in like tumblin' weeds
Good and happy

Blood Brothers Lyrics
[Verse 1]
We were as young as we were dumb
When we piled in an old pile of junk
It was one for all, and all for one
A bunch of outlaws without a gun
Shootin' bad booze outta Dixie cups
Chasin' every girl that wasn't fast enough
No matter how bad the break or how bad the luck
Or how bad the day we still had us
[Chorus]
Blood brothers closer than your next to kin
Thick as thieves and the best of friends
Take a bullet for each other
Yeah, brothers like that don't come cheap
You fight, you cry, you lie, you bleed
And you lean on one another
Blood brothers
[Verse 2]
I got a scar on my cheek from a bar room brawl
Wasn't meant for me but I took the fall
It's a cowboy code, it's an unwrote law
When you mess with one you gotta take us all
[Chorus]
Blood brothers closer than your next to kin
Thick as thieves and the best of friends
Take a bullet for each other
Yeah, brothers like that don't come cheap
You fight, you cry, you lie, you bleed
And you lean on one another
Blood brothers, yeah, yeah, uh huh[Bridge]
Time can fly on by, everything can change
Until the day we die, we'll always remain
Yeah, we'll remain
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Thick as thieves and the best of friends
Take a bullet for each other

Had to hit my old town to duck the news
Two-four hour lockdown, we made no moves
Now it's 4 a.m. and I'm back up poppin' with the crew

Memory Box Lyrics
[Verse 1]
So move over darling
If my heart bends
I'll know
And if I heard you stayed
You know I would have stayed
So baby don't hold me back
'Cause if I win
I'll change
And if I lose my way
You know I would escape

Damaged by the sea
The sun blaze over me
Oh baby tie me down
I'm dangling, Oh
Past the storm
[Verse 2]
And if you change your heart
Doesn't mean I'm erased
And if I say I know
Would it be a mistake
I was once away
And now I'm just in place
And if I lose my way
I know I would be safe[Chorus]
Damaged by the sea
The sun blaze over me
Oh baby tie me down
I'm dangling! Oh
Past the storm
[Verse 3]
Oh this is what I'll say
Just imagine I'm late
I will take my chance
And now this must end
No I won't hold you back
You're a star babe‚ go fly
And if you lose your way
You know I won't be safe
[Chorus]
Damaged by the sea
The sun blaze over me
Oh baby tie me down
I'm dangling dangling
Oh you (keep)

So let's get to the good part

Come off that watch and chain 'fore I blow out your brains
Shells hit your chest, go out your back, mane (Back, mane)
See me, I put in work, man, I been doing dirt
For so long, them niggas get laid out (Laid out)
Niggas run through my crib to holla at the kid
That's when I start bringing them thangs out (Thangs out)
Then we go through the strip hanging up out the whip
Dumping clips off at they whole clique, mane (Clique, mane)
When witnesses around they know how we get down
So when the cops come, they ain't see shit, mane (Shit, mane)
My soldiers slanging 'caine, sunny, snowy, sleet or rain
Come through the hood and you can cop that (Cop that)
I'm sittin' on some change, G-Unit, that's the gang
Come through here stunting you'll get popped at (Popped at)
[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I love to pump crack, love to stay strapped
Love to squeeze gats, but you don't hear me though
I love to hit the block, I love my two Glocks
Love to bust shots, but you don't hear me though
I love to pump crack, love to stay strapped
Love to squeeze gats, but you don't hear me though
I love to hit the block, I love my two Glocks
Love to bust shots, but you don't hear me though[Verse 2: Young Buck]
I came in this game knowing niggas gon' hate me
Just for the simple fact they know that I'm a rider (Rider)
I got a hell of a aim, I keep on telling you, mane
I swear ain't nobody gon' find ya (Find ya)
When I get lifted, I'm tempted to tear your block up
You niggas can't run 'cause I'm behind ya (Behind ya)
Me and Chili in your city with a couple nine millis
You better stay in line, bro (Line, bro)
'Cause if I walk it I'll talk it, you know we'll walk up and pop it

Scarecrows Lyrics
[Verse 1]
We didn't have no downtown strip
We'd all pile in and take a 2 mile trip
To where the road runs out
Sit there and sip on whatever anybody's older brother could get
Where we worked in the dirt and fell in love
Got my heart broke, broke down my truck
Trying to spin out, show off in that mud too many times
[Pre-Chorus]
So much has changed
But then again, it ain't
[Chorus]
Just like the scarecrows, even when the wind blows
We keep our boots and our roots in these cornrows
Where we threw down and we passed it around every Friday night
Just some old plowboys pretending we're cowboys
We came from nothing, oh, but look at us now, boys
Even when we leave here, we'll always be here, wherever we go
Just like the scarecrows
[Verse 2]
I don't get back near enough and just like these fields
Yeah, we all grow up
And it takes a little more than a paper cup to get dizzy
This hundred acre stretch is buried in my bones
Don't matter how long that I've been gone
I can be anywhere and some song comes on
And it's like I never left home[Chorus]
Just like the scarecrows, even when the wind blows
We keep our boots and our roots in these cornrows
Where we threw down and we passed it around every Friday night
Just some old plowboys pretending we're cowboys
We came from nothing, oh, but look at us now, boys
Even when we leave here, we'll always be here, wherever we go
Just like the scarecrows
[Pre-Chorus]
So much has changed
But then again, it ain't
[Chorus]
Just like the scarecrows, even when the wind blows
We keep our boots and our roots in these cornrows
Where we threw down and we passed it around on a Friday night
Just some old plowboys pretending we're cowboys
We came from nothing, oh, but look at us now, boys
Even when we leave here, we'll always be here, wherever we go
Just like the scarecrows

[Chorus]
I said, ""Oh, my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight
[Verse 1]
I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
Picked me up, late one night out the window
We were 17 and crazy, running wild, wild
Can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince
[Chorus]
And I said, ""Oh, my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing

Like we're made of starlight, starlight
[Verse 2]
He said, “Look at you, worrying too much about things you can't change
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way""
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me
""Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?""[Chorus]
Like, ""Oh, my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Ooh-ooh, he's talking crazy
Ooh-ooh, dancing with me
Ooh-ooh, we could get married
Have ten kids and teach 'em how to dream

It was the best night, never would forget how he moved

Little Less Broken Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Of all the bars you could've walked your boots into
Why'd it have to be the one that I picked too?
I just wanted a place to sip my way through missin' you
You didn't see me when you walked past me
I wasn't ready to see you this happy
[Chorus]
Looks like I'm movin' just a little less on with this
Looks like your world has got a little less wrong with it
Looks like it took you just a little less time
Looks like your heart's just a little less broken than mine
A little less broken than mine (A little less broken than mine)
[Verse 2]
To Hell with killin' what's left of this Walker Black
'Cause I ain't lettin' you know that I hurt this bad
I'll just hang my head underneath this hat, and slip out the back
I'm dealin' with not being together
So are you but you're doin' it better
[Chorus]
It looks like I'm movin' just a little less on with this
Looks like your world has got a little less wrong with it
Looks like it took you just a little less time
Looks like your heart's just a little less broken than mine[Bridge]
Maybe goodbye didn't hit you the way that it hit me
Guess hearts don't ever break fifty-fifty
[Chorus]
Oh, 'cause it looks like I'm movin' just a little less on with this
Looks like your world has got a little less wrong with it
Looks like it's takin' me a little more time

Nothing can come between us
When it gets dark, I tow your heart away

Had a laugh and over dinner
Told her I would really like to see her again (Tchic, tchic, tchic, tchic, tchic, tchic, tchic)
Got the bill and Rita paid it

Took her home, I nearly made it (Tchic, tchic, tchic, tchic, tchic, tchic, tchic)
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two

[Intro]
We met each other on the neon dinghy
Past the manta rays and palm trees
Glowing creatures beamed down from great heights
Electric eels and red venom
In the sky, we could see the riders on the horseback
On comets, coming toward us, kicking up with laughter
My friend Big Twitchy rode the boat into the light
Surfed to the north break
We danced until there was nothing left
Just me and Twitchy
'Cause that's all we knew
[Interlude]
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
[Chorus]
You're questioning the science, 'cause you don't understand
How I'm doing what I'm doing in a fucking handstand
You found it so impressive that I do it again
My other one is busy, so I use my left hand
We took it kinda fast but you put it in slow
I see your mother's calling and you're hitting ignore
It's like you saw a unicorn, you don't understand
How I'm doin' what I'm doin' in a fucking handstand[Bridge]
I wish I could crawl inside your heart
Take you captive and then sail away
I wish I could know that it's forever
Take me captive and then sail away
[Chorus]
You're questioning the science, 'cause you don't understand
How I'm doing what I'm doing in a fucking handstand
You found it so impressive that I do it again
My other one is busy, so I use my left hand
We took it kinda fast but you put it in slow
I see your mother's calling and you're hitting ignore
It's like you saw a unicorn, you don't understand

The lyrics paint a picture of a surreal and magical encounter, where the two friends meet ""past the manta rays and palm trees"" and are surrounded by glowing creatures and electric eels.

The chorus' lyric ""You're questioning the science, 'cause you don't understand, How I'm doing what I'm doing in a fucking handstand,"" highlights the idea of doing something unconventional and unique that others might not understand. Cyrus is using the metaphor of a handstand to represent her unconventional and unique approach to life. She's saying that she's not doing things the way that others expect her to, but instead is using a different perspective, or a different ""hand"" to approach life.

The bridge, ""I wish I could crawl inside your heart, Take you captive and then sail away, I wish I could know that it's forever, Take me captive and then sail away"", could mean that Miley is longing for a connection with others, to understand them and have them understand her. She wants to have an intimate connection with someone, but also acknowledges the fact that it's difficult to know if that connection will be permanent.

In summary, the song ""Handstand"" is an introspective reflection on Miley Cyrus' unconventional approach to life and how that approach can make others feel confused or unable to understand her. The song also touches on the desire for closeness and permanence in a connection with another person. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Miley+Cyrus/_/Handstand"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Can't short my stock, I still stack tall, you still can't trade me

[Intro: James Blake]
Where will you go now
Now that you're done with me?
Where will you go now
Now that you're done with me?
I don't blame you
You should be done with me
I don't blame you
You should be done
[Verse 1: James Blake]
Why won't you even talk about it?
Or even hear about it?
Or even feel about it? 
(
Metro
)
Like the covers come off in the heat
We don't have to lie
We don't have to lie right here
And it's alright
I should've waited somehow
I shouldn't have pushed so hard
I always push too hard
And now it's just a blackout
And now it's just a blackout
(Somehow)
[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
My mama always told me, ""Put yourself first""
I don't really fall in love with women, man, 'cause love hurt
I hit a couple broads, I can't lie, I put my dick first
Now you runnin' 'round playin' payback and that shit hurt
I should've treated you better (21)
Used to deal with lames 'til she ran into a stepper (On God)
Big dawg Savage, I'm a Zone 6 repper (21)
Niggas throwin' salt, but the Draco came with pepper (Straight up)
She say we ain't goin' nowhere 'cause all I do is sext her (On God)
Woah, never knew that I had to propose, no (21)
I was fine with you bein' one of my hoes, for sure (On God)
She said she seen us bein' somebody goals, what are those? (21)
I thought about givin' you the key to my heart, but it's froze[Chorus: Travis Scott & James Blake,

(Ooh) If energy makes energy
X-rated love, X-rated love
If energy makes energy, makes energy
X-rated love, X-rated love (Mm, ha, ha)
[Verse 3: Travis Scott]
You know the love was X-rated, it's how we made it
Drinkin' help balance the patience, watch how you take it
Can't keep no bitches, it's too dangerous, I been X-rated
Took everything up for the takin', I couldn't save it
See red and blues, I hit the pavement
Got low, got vacant
She needed angles, I need angels
I'm fightin' Satan
Leave me faded, I feel painless
I go out gracious
I'm tryna feel the shade of greatness by celebratin'
Bring entertainment, goin' brainless, like goin' dumb on my hiatus
She fall more in love every time that I tip
I fade away every time that I
Take a sip, I been goin' off the rip
I been bumpin' more Coldplay, the world cold as shit
I know one thing 'bout the old one, can have more fun with it
Knew exactly how to roll one and how to tote a stick
Even if she at the shows, so she never let 'em hit
Always knew she always on one and I can bare with it
Yeah, I can bare with it[Chorus: James Blake]

Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain in
Southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes don't shed tears, but, boy, they pour when

Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever, ooh
[Verse 2]
No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
That's why I kissed you
Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it though
I'm lying down[Pre-Chorus]

In May of 2012, the song was officially sent to radio and released onto iTunes as a single by Ocean. Kelly would later release her own version of the track entitled ""Thinking Bout Forever"".

Lyrically, the track is about a relationship just out of his reach and the turmoil that ensues. The track also explores feelings of regret and heartbreak. The song received highly positive reviews from music critics, who praised the atmospheric production, Ocean's falsetto and writing ability. Some critics noted the possible bisexual undertones featured on the track (as stated above, however, the song was initially intended as a demo version of a song for a female singer, Bridget Kelly). Complex magazine named it the fourth best track of 2011.

In September 2012, the song peaked at position 32 on the Billboard Hot 100, 117 on the UK Singles Chart, and 13 on the Heatseekers Songs chart. In 2011, the song received a music video directed by visual art group High5Collective released on September 15. Ocean appears in the violent clip revolving around an inter-dimensional love story and zombies. Ocean performed the track during his seven-show tour through North America and Europe in November 2011, at the April 2012 Coachella Musical Festival, and his supporting tour for Channel Orange. ""Thinkin Bout You"" has been certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America, for shipments of 500,000 copies in the United States. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Frank+Ocean/_/Thinkin+Bout+You"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

​hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have - but i have it Lyrics

[Verse 1]
I was reading Slim Aarons and I got to thinking that I thought
Maybe I'd get less stressed if I was tested less like
All of these debutantes
Smiling for miles in pink dresses and high heels on white yachts
But I'm not, baby, I'm not
No, I'm not, that, I'm not
[Chorus]
I've been tearing around in my fucking nightgown
24/7 Sylvia Plath
Writing in blood on my walls
'Cause the ink in my pen don't work in my notepad
Don't ask if I'm happy, you know that I'm not
But at best, I can say I'm not sad
'Cause hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
[Verse 2]
I had 15-year dances
Church basement romances, yeah, I've cried
Spilling my guts with the Bowery Bums
Is the only love I've ever known
Except for the stage, which I also call home, when I'm not
Servin' up God in a burnt coffee pot for the triad
Hello, it's the most famous woman you know on the iPad
Calling from beyond the grave, I just wanna say, ""Hi, Dad""[Chorus]
I've been tearing up town in my fucking white gown
Like a goddamn near sociopath
Shaking my ass is the only thing that's
Got this black narcissist off my back
She couldn't care less, and I never cared more
So there's no more to say about that
Except hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman with my past
[Bridge]
There's a new revolution, a loud evolution that I saw
Born of confusion and quiet collusion of which mostly I've known
A modern day woman with a weak constitution, 'cause I've got
Monsters still under my bed that I could never fight off
A gatekeeper carelessly dropping the keys on my nights off
[Chorus]
I've been tearing around in my fucking nightgown
24/7 Sylvia Plath
Writing in blood on your walls
'Cause the ink in my pen don't look good in my pad
They write that I'm happy, they know that I'm not
But at best, you can see I'm not sad
But hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have[Outro]
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
But I have it
Yeah, I have it
Yeah, I have it
I have",https://genius.com/Lana-del-rey-hope-is-a-dangerous-thing-for-a-woman-like-me-to-have-but-i-have-it-lyrics,"""hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have - but i have it"" is a introspective, confessional ballad, where the singer shares her struggles with mental health and self-esteem and how those are aggravated by the societal expectations women face. The song title refers to her feelings of hope and how dangerous they can be when everything else seems to be falling apart.

In the verses, Del Rey talks about feeling out of place compared to the wealthy, privileged debutantes she sees and reads about. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Lana+Del+Rey/_/hope+is+a+dangerous+thing+for+a+woman+like+me+to+have+-+but+i+have+it"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","""hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have - but i have it"" is a introspective, confessional ballad, where the singer shares her struggles with mental health and self-esteem and how those are aggravated by the societal expectations women face. The song title refers to her feelings of hope and how dangerous they can be when everything else seems to be falling apart.

In the verses, Del Rey talks about feeling out of place compared to the wealthy, privileged debutantes she sees and reads about. She also mentions her experience with abusive relationships, hinted at by the reference to ""church basement romances"" and ""spilling my guts with the Bowery Bums"". She seems to find solace in artistic expression, but even that is not always a safe haven as her ""ink in my pen don't work in my notepad"".

The chorus repeats the title phrase, emphasizing how hope, despite being a positive feeling, can be perilous for someone in her position. She also mentions how others perceive her versus how she really feels, highlighting the disconnect between her public persona and her private struggles.

The bridge introduces the idea of a ""new revolution"" and a ""modern day woman with a weak constitution"", hinting at the changing landscape of societal expectations for women and the toll it can take on mental health. However, she still struggles with the same fears and insecurities, symbolized by the ""monsters still under my bed"", and feels powerless to overcome them.

The outro repeats the title phrase, but this time with a sense of defiance and strength. Del Rey acknowledges the danger of hope but chooses to hold onto it anyway, declaring that she has it and will not give it up. Overall, the song is a poignant reflection on the struggles that come with mental health and societal pressures and the bravery it takes to hold onto hope despite everything. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Lana+Del+Rey/_/hope+is+a+dangerous+thing+for+a+woman+like+me+to+have+-+but+i+have+it"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

[Verse 1]
Lovers kiss in a garden made of thorns
Traces of lonely words, illusions torn
[Pre-Chorus]
You said, ""How does a man like me love a woman like you?""
I said, ""Hold me until I die and I'll make you brand new""
[Chorus]
Come on and wrap that blade of grass
Around my finger like a cast
'Cause even though the church burned down
I'll be your queen without a crown
I've been so lonely in this field
Fighting a battle with no shield
Come on and wrap that blade of grass
And we'll make it last
[Verse 2]
This is the lawn of memories I mourn
I fall into your eyes, shelter from storm
[Pre-Chorus]
You said, ""How does a man like me love a woman like you?""

Come on and wrap that blade of grass
And we'll make it last
Come on and wrap that blade of grass
And we'll make it last
[Bridge]
I'll give you something
Yeah, it's no diamond ring
The air that I'm breathing
Forever's not enough
A song we'll both sing
Yeah, it's not the same thing
Yeah, it's not the same thing
Forever's not enough
[Chorus]
Come on and wrap that blade of grass
Around my finger like a cast
'Cause even though the church burned down
I'll be your queen without a crown
I've been so lonely in this field
Fighting a battle with no shield

I miss Long Beach and I miss you, babe
I miss dancing with you the most of all
I miss the bar where the Beach Boys would go
Dennis' last stop before Kokomo

Those nights were on fire
We couldn't get higher
We didn't know that we had it all
But nobody warns you before the fall

I'm facing the greatest
The greatest loss of them all
The culture is lit and I had a ball
I guess I'm signing off after all

I miss New York and I miss the music
Me and my friends‚ we miss rock 'n' roll
I want shit to feel just like it used to
When‚ baby, I was doing nothin' the most of all[Pre-Chorus]
The culture is lit, and if this is it‚ I had a ball
I guess that I'm burned out after all

Don't leave, I just need a wake-up call

The greatest loss of them all

If this is it, I'm signing off
Miss doing nothin' the most of all

In the pre-chorus and chorus, we see her expressing her profound sadness and despair at potentially facing the greatest loss of all: the loss of innocence and familiarity that comes with growing older. The chorus also makes clear that Lana isn't sure if she's prepared for the change that's coming, thus expressing her fear about the unknown. In the second verse she references her time spent in New York and misses rock 'n' roll, signifying the nostalgia she's feeling for her past life. The outro brings her back to Long Beach and points out the changes that have occurred since she was younger, such as Kanye West going blonde and the idea of Life on Mars seeming more like a reality.

Everything is never-ending

Beating Around the Bush Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Smilin' face and lovin' eyes
But you keep on tellin' me all those lies
How'd you expect me to believe?
Honey, I ain't that naïve
Baby, I've got my eye on you
'Cause you do all the things I want you to
Stop your cryin' and dry your tears
I ain’t that wet behind the ears
[Chorus]
And you can throw me lefts
And you can throw me rights
But where was you last night?
Beatin' around the bush
[Verse 2]
Wish I knew what's on your mind
And why you're being so unkind
Remember those nights we spent alone
Talkin' on the telephone?
Thoughts of you go through my brain
Told me that you felt the same
Don't say that you love me too
Tell me, who would lie with you?[Chorus]
I was talkin' birds
And you was talkin' bees
Or was he down upon his knees?
Beatin' around the bush
Ow
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
You're the meanest woman I've ever known
Sticks and stones won't break my bones
I know what you're lookin' for
You've eaten your cake, you want some more
I'm gonna give you just one more chance
Try to save our romance
Done everythin' I'm gonna do
The rest is up to you
[Chorus]
And you can chew it up
And you can spit it out
Let it all hang out
Beatin' around the bush
Ow[Guitar Solo]

Chew it up
Spit it out
Let it all hang out

west side Lyrics
Ariana Grande’s “west side” is the 10th track off of her 2020 studio album, “positions.” The song is centered around the idea of being picky with her love. Ariana is demanding in an enticing way on this track.
[Verse 1]
I don't wanna think too much
I just wanna feel
You know that it ain't no rush
Let me keep it real
Just let me be in your life like that
In your life like that
I'll bring the light right back
I'll bring the life right back
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna make you want more (More)
I'm gonna be your new favorite
Tell 'em you closing the door
I am the only for sure
Oh, babe
[Chorus]
Hold up, there shouldn't be no hold up
There's more love if you follow emotions
Show up, now if you're down to roll up
Meet me on the west side for me
Hold up, there shouldn't be no hold up
There's more love if you follow emotions
Show up, now if you're down to roll up
Meet me[Verse 2]
I don't want it if it ain't your touch
It's better every time we chill
You ain't gotta bring no stuff
We got all we need right here
Just let me be in your life like that
Be your wife like that
I'll bring the light right back
I'll bring the life right back
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna make you want more (More)
I'm gonna be your new favorite
Tell 'em you closing the door
I am the only for sure, baby

You feel some type of way, then a-ha!

Ever since a young man (Since a young man)
All I wanna be was a gunman (Was a gunman)
Shootin’ up the charts, better run, man
Y'all gotta see that I won, man

Handle bars like a fade, watch me work it, JT
I'm at large, runnin’ plays like a circuit, JT
I'm sellin' verses, JT, watch me work it, JT
Look, look… hol' up!
Don't judge me! My mama caught me with a strap
Don't judge me! I was young, fuckin' all the brats
Don't judge me! Aimin’ at your head for a stack
Don’t judge! Don't judge me! Now my home got a Valley peak
Don’t judge me! If I press your line you a freak
Don't judge me! Won't you tell a friend? Y'all gon’ see—

Fuck is you talkin' to?
Ayy, do you know who you talkin' to?
Slide on you like fallen drapes
God toss full of carnivals
I kill 'em with kindness
Or I kill 'em with diamonds
Or I put up like fifteen hundred
Get yo' ass killed by the finest
Everything in life is a gamble
Nothin' in life I can't handle
Seen it all, done it all, felt pain more
For the cause, I done put blood on sword
Everything I do is to embrace y'all
Everything I write is a damn eight ball
Everything I touch is a damn gold mine
Everything I say is from an angel
[Bridge]
I don't rush shit, fuck shit, always your shit, my shit
Cannonballs to ignite shit, morning to the night shift
I'm on, I ain't sorry for it
Asked for a piece of mind, you charged me for it
I wanna see sometimes if you ignore it
I'm in the streets sometimes and can't afford it
I got a bad habit, levitatin', duckin' haters
Oh my! My heart is rich, my heart is famous[Chorus]
This what God feel like

Get It Right The First Time Lyrics
Track 8 on Billy Joel’s 5th album, “The Stranger”

Joel is hoping to impress a girl, but worries that, if he messes up, he won’t get a second chance.
So he has to “get it right the first time.”
[Verse 1]
I don't believe in first impressions
For just this once I hope
That looks don't deceive
I ain't got time for true confessions
[Pre-Chorus]
Got to make the move right now
Got to meet that girl somehow
[Chorus]
Get it right the first time
That's the main thing
I can't afford to let it pass
You get it right the next time
That's not the same thing
Gonna make the first time last
[Verse 2]
I'm not much good at conversation
I never was much good
At coming on real strong
But if all it takes is inspiration
[Pre-Chorus]
Then I might have just what it takes
If I don't make no bad mistakes
And I[Chorus]
Get it right the first time
'Cause that's the main thing
I can't afford to let it pass
You get it right the next time
That's not the same thing
Gonna have to make the first time last
[Bridge]
I might find the courage
Yeah, I might get up the nerve
But if my timing ain't just right
What purpose would that serve?
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
How to say those first few words
If I want to put myself in touch
The first few moments mean so much
[Verse 3]
So I suppose it's now or never
Before that woman
Walks right out of my life
Just let me pull myself together

[Intro: Derek Shulman]
The situation we are in at this time
Neither a good one, nor is it so unblessed
It can change, it can stay the same
I can say, I can make my claim
Hail, hail, hail
[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Yeah
Okay, this shit is outta control
I'm drivin' through Hell and I done brought snow
It's shinin' in here, then I done brought glow
I hear the sirens right out the chateau, run me the info
Tryna hear what you did, not how you came close
'Cause I get bobblehead like I done made pro
I made Italian bread like I done made dough
I be all around the map
Write a show 'bout myself like I'm Chelsea Handler
Or write a series 'bout my bitches like I'm Kelsey Grammer
Nicknamed the jet Jayhawk 'cause it's outta Kansas
You know it's Spaldin' in my top, I'm in my esperanza
You know it's slammin' wall to wall
We gotta fill the stands up with slaps and the anthems
Poetic justice, I got you in all my stanzas
With your model stances, you everything I know about it[Refrain: Travis Scott]
Know about it, know about it
Know about it, know about it (Ah)
Know about it, know about it
Know about it, know about it
[Break: Travis Scott]
What we know
Where you shall go
Power, ah
[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Uh, yeah
C-notes
, B-notes, I took the biggest boat
We stayed down for life, it's like a jingle to do 'em all
We too much involved to spend a single ounce of time
She bust a whole ounce by doin' lines
I had to leave, like the leaves do trees
I'm finally home, I wiped the stress, then I touched that sweat
We took 'em 35 to 1 like this shit roulette
Hold up, beg your pardon, we done lit up, baby
Set up, told the preacher, ""Never finish,"" that's to say the least
Buy it, never lease it, but I gotta lease it
Mobile, Mona type of pieces, Met Gala, night Jesus
Skip it, hit the city, party pack, I got it with me
I'm shotty while I let you with me
I'm too bent to let you ride, barely 'til it's empty
Gotta feel me, 
pockets dumb fat and I got a skinny
Squad is with me, and that's everything I know about it[Refrain: Travis Scott]
I know about it, I know about it
I know about it, I know about it
I know about it, I know about it
I know about it, I know about it
I know about it, I know about it
I know about it, I know about it
[Outro: George Clinton]
Mother Earth is pregnant for the third time
For y'all have knocked her up
I have tasted the maggots in the mind of the universe
I was not offended
For I knew I had to rise above it all

AC/DC had made several studio albums before and was constantly supporting them by going on a grueling tour schedule.

The song and album's title supposedly came after a reporter asked bandmembers if they could describe what life was like being constantly on tour. Angus replied that it was ""a fucking highway to Hell""[citation needed], and the name stuck. He stated in the magazine ""Guitar World"" that when you are out on the road on a bus sleeping with a guy's smelly sock in your face, it's like you're on the highway to hell. Rumours persisted that the band members were satanists, and this comment, and the album cover depicting Angus with devil horns and tail only added fuel to the fire. (The band has denied having anything to do with Satanism, Malcolm having even commented that ""me mum would kill me for that!"") Nevertheless, this and other songs brought AC/DC its first million-copy-selling album, and sent Highway to Hell to #17 on the charts. Scott would be found dead in the back of a friend's car just over six months later. The success of the Highway to Hell song and album set AC/DC on track to record its most famous album and tribute to Bon, Back In Black, one year later. The song ""Highway to Hell"" is part of the The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll list.[1] The single was certified Gold by the RIAA for sales in excess of 500,000. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/AC%2FDC/_/Highway+to+Hell"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

While talking to Zach Sang, in the first part of their interview, she explains that she “took notes” on the songs that were leaked which she was planning to revisit, and said “they’re completely different now”. The track also ties into the following track on the tracklist, “the boy is mine”, and Grande said to Zane Lowe and Apple Music, “It’s an untrue story, based on all untrue events. It sets up “the boy is mine” obviously. It’s kind of like, “Okay, I’ll play the bad girl.

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre & 
Knoc-turn'al
]
Things just ain't the same for gangstas
Times is changin', young niggas is agin'
Becoming OG's in the game and changin'
To make way for these new names and faces
But the strangest things can happen from rappin'
When niggas get wrapped up in image and actin'
Niggas get capped up and wrapped in plastic
Zipped up in bags, when it happens – that's it
I've seen 'em come, I've watched them go
Watched them rise, witnessed it, and watched them blow
Watched them all blossom, and watched them grow
Watched the lawsuits when they lost the dough
Best friends and money? I lost them both
Went and visited niggas in the hospital
It's all the same shit all across the globe
I just sit back and watch the show (
The Watcher
)
[Chorus: Eminem & 
Knoc-turn'al
]
Everywhere that I go
Ain't the same as befo' (
The Watcher
)
People I used to know
Just don't know me no mo' (
The watcher
)
But everywhere that I go
I got people I know (
The Watcher
)
Who got people they know
So I suggest you lay low
 
(
I'm watchin'
)[Verse 2: Dr. Dre & 
Knoc-turn'al
]
I moved out of the hood for good – you blame me?
Niggas aim, mainly, at niggas they can't be
But niggas can't hit niggas they can't see
I'm out of sight now, I'm out of their dang reach
How would you feel if niggas wanted you killed?
You'd probably move to a new house on a new hill
And choose a new spot, if niggas wanted you shot
I ain't a thug – how much 2Pac in you you got?
I ain't no bitch, neither
It's either my life or your, life and I ain't leavin' – I like breathin'
'Cause, nigga, we can go round for round
Clip for clip – shit, four pound for pound
Nigga, if you really want to take it there, we can
Just remember that you fuckin' with a family man
I got a lot more to lose than you
Remember that when you wanna come and fill these shoes
 (
The Watcher
)
[Chorus: Eminem &

Everywhere that I go
Ain't the same as befo' (

Knoc-turn'al
]
Things just ain't the same for gangstas
Cops is anxious to put niggas in handcuffs
They wanna hang us, see us dead, or enslave us
Keep us trapped in the same place we raised in
Then, they wonder why we act so outrageous
Run around, stressed out and pull out gauges
'Cause every time you let the animal out cages
It's dangerous to people who look like strangers
But now, we got a new era of gangstas
Hustlers and youngsters livin' amongst us
Lookin' at us now, callin' us busters
Can't help but reminisce back when it was us
Nigga, we started this gangsta shit!
And this the motherfuckin' thanks I get?
It's funny how time flies
I'm just having fun, just watchin' it fly by

[Intro]
Nobody pray for me
It been that day for me
Way (Yeah, yeah)
[Verse 1]
Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now I'm countin’ this
Parmesan where my accountant lives, in fact, I'm downin' this
D’ussé with my boo bae, tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy your ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down, we playin' Tetris
A.m. to the p.m., p.m. to the a.m., funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know
[Chorus]
Bitch, be humble (Hold up, bitch)
Sit down (Hold up, lil'— hold up, lil' bitch)

Be humble (Hold up, bitch)
Sit down (Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up)[Verse 2]
Who that nigga thinkin' that he frontin' on Man-Man? (Man-Man)
Get the fuck off my stage, I'm the Sandman (Sandman)
Get the fuck off my dick, that ain't right
I make a play fucking up your whole life
I'm so fuckin' sick and tired of the Photoshop
Show me somethin' natural like afro on Richard Pryor
Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretch marks
Still'll take you down right on your mama couch in Polo socks
Ayy, this shit way too crazy, ayy, you do not amaze me, ayy
I blew cool from AC, ayy, Obama just paged me, ayy
I don't fabricate it, ayy, most of y'all be fakin', ayy
I stay modest 'bout it, ayy, she elaborate it, ayy
This that Grey Poupon, that Evian, that TED Talk, ayy
Watch my soul speak, you let the meds talk, ayy
If I kill a nigga, it won't be the alcohol, ayy
I'm the realest nigga after all

1000 Doves Lyrics
[Verse 1]

I cry more than I ever say (Oh)

She promises to catch their tears as they fall and be there for them just as she wishes someone would be there for her.

The chorus is a request for help and support from others to lift her up and give her a start. Gaga compares herself to a bird with broken wings, but believes that with just a little help and encouragement, she can fly again like a thousand doves. The post-chorus repeats the image of the doves and serves to reinforce the idea of freedom and soaring above one's problems.

The bridge reveals some of the pain and frustration that the singer has been experiencing, trapped in a cage and struggling with internal turmoil. She begs for someone to set her free if they truly love her, but also acknowledges that it may be time to let go if they do not.

Overall, the song is a plea for connection and understanding, with Gaga using the imagery of doves as a symbol of hope and freedom. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Lady+Gaga/_/1000+Doves"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Bitches Ain’t Shit Lyrics
Built around the opening bassline from Parliament’s “Adolescent Funk,” Dre, Daz, Kurupt, and Snoop grab the mic to talk about women who aren’t very respectable. Dr. Dre uses his verse to fire shots at Eazy-E…

[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts, then suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
Then I hops in my coupe to make a quick run
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts, then suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
Then I hops in my coupe to make a quick run
[
Verse 1: Dr. Dre
]
I used to know a bitch named Eric Wright
We used to roll around and fuck the hoes at night
Tighter than a motherfucker with the gangster beats
And we was ballin' on the motherfuckin' Compton streets, peep
The shit got deep and it was on
Number one song after number one song
Long as my motherfuckin' pockets was fat
I didn't give a fuck where the bitch was at
But she was hangin' with a white bitch, doin' the shit she do
Suckin' on his dick just to get a buck or two
And the few ends she got didn't mean nothin'
Now she's suin' 'cause shit that she be doin' ain't shit
Bitch can't hang with the streets, she found herself short
So now she takin' me to court
It's real conversation for your ass
So recognize and pass to Daz[Verse 2: Dat Nigga Daz & 
Snoop Dogg
]
Now as I'm rollin' with my nigga Dre 
and Eastwood
Fuckin' hoes, clockin' dough, up to no good
We flip-flop and serve hoes like flapjacks
(
But we don't love them hoes
)
 Bitch, and it's like that
This is what you look for in a ho who got cash flow
You run up in them hoes and grab the cash and get your dash on
While you're chillin' with your homies and shit
And how my niggas kick the anthem like this (Biatch)
[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts, then suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
Then I hops in my coupe to make a quick run
[Verse 3: Kurupt & 
Snoop Dogg
]
To the store to get me a 4-0
Snoop Doggy Dogg paged, that must mean more hoes
So I head down the streets to Long Beach
Just, so I could meet a freak
To lick me from my head to my feet
And I'm here, now I'm ready to be done up
Nothin' but homies around, so I puts my gun up
Bitches on my nuts like clothes, hah
But I'm from Tha Pound and we don't love them hoes
How could you trust a ho? (
Why?
) 'Cause a ho's a trick
I don't love them tricks (
Why?
) 'cause a trick's a bitch
And my dick's constantly in her mouth
Turnin' them trick-ass hoes the fuck out now[Verse 4: Snoop Dogg]
I once had a bitch named Mandy May
Used to be all in them guts like every day
The pussy was the bomb, had a nigga on sprung
I was in love like a motherfucker, lickin' the pearl tongue
The homies used to tell me that she wasn't no good
But I'm the maniac in black, 
Mr. Snoop Eastwood
So I figured niggas wouldn't trip with mine
Guess what? Got gaffled by one-time
I'm back to the motherfuckin' county jail
Six months on my chest, now it's time to bail
Uh, I gets released on a hot sunny day
My nigga D.O.C. and my homie Dr. Dre
Scoop in a coupe, ""Snoop, we got news
Your girl was trickin' while you was draped in your county blues""
I ain't been out a second
And already gotta do some motherfuckin' chin-checkin
'
Move up the blocks as we groove up the block
See my girl's house, ""Dre, pass the Glock""
Kick in the door, I look on the floor
It's 
my lil' cousin Daz
 and he's fuckin' my ho, yo
(Bitches ain't shit) I un-cock my shit
I'm heartbroke but I'm still loc'ed, man, fuck a bitch
[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts, then suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
Then I hops in my coupe to make a quick run
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
Then I hops in my coupe to make a quick run
Bitches ain't shit[Verse 5: Jewell & 
Dr Dre
]
Ooh, yeah, oh-oh, yeah
I don't give a fuck about a bitch (
Bitches ain't shit
)
But I'll let her know that she can't fade this
'Cause I'm doin' my own thing (
Bitches ain't shit
)
Down with the swang (Sing to these hoes)
I'm hangin' with Death Row like it ain't no thang
I say you know you can't deal (
Bitches ain't shit
, Death Row)
'Cause I'm a bitch that's real
Motherfuckers need to step back
Hell yeah, they need to chill (Tell these motherfuckers)
Because I don't give a fuck (
Bitches ain't shit
), and I don't give a fuck
And I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck (Tell these motherfuckers)
And now I gotta do some—
I gotta do some shit that's clean (
Bitches ain't shit
)
But when I'm on the dick, hell yeah, I get real mean, hah
Like a washing machine, I can wash the clothes
All the hoes knows that I'm on the floor, ho (
Bitches ain't shit
)
But they can't hang with my type of swang
I ain't tryna say I suck every ding-a-lang
But just the juicy ones with the tip of the tongue
And then they're sprung and with their nuts hung

[Verse 1]
While in these days of quiet desperation
As I wander through the world in which I live
I search everywhere for some new inspiration
But it's more than cold reality can give
If I need a cause for celebration
Or a comfort I can use to ease my mind
I rely on my imagination
And I dream of an imaginary time
[Chorus]
I know that everybody has a dream
Everybody has a dream
Everybody has a dream
And this is my dream, my own
Just to be at home
And to be all alone with you
[Verse 2]
If I believe in all the words I'm saying
And if a word from you can bring a better day
Then all I have are these games that I've been playing
To keep my hope from crumbling away
So let me lie and let me go on sleeping
And I will lose myself in palaces of sand
And all the fantasies that I will be keeping
Will make the empty hours easier, easier to stand[Chorus]
And I know that everybody has a dream
Everybody has a dream
Everybody has a dream
And this is my dream, my own
Just to be at home
And to be all alone
All alone with you, oh
With you
[Outro]
I know that everybody has a dream
Oh, everybody has a dream
And I know everybody has a dream
Everybody, everybody, everybody (Everybody has a dream)
I know that everybody has a dream

So pardon if I'm impolite

But I'm turnt up upstairs and I love you
Is the only thing that's in my mind

Just come over, let's pour a drink, babe
I hope I ain't calling you too late, too late

[Verse 1]
Salt air, and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of ""Are you sure?""
""Never have I ever before""
[Chorus]
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine
[Verse 2]
Your back beneath the sun
Wishin' I could write my name on it
Will you call when you're back at school?
I remember thinkin' I had you

Wanting was enough
For me, it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case you'd call
And say, ""Meet me behind the mall""
So much for summer love and saying ""us""
'Cause you weren't mine to lose
You weren't mine to lose, no

August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

Never mine

Tell Me Why Lyrics
[Chorus]
Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me
[Verse 1]
Well, I gave you everything I had
But you left me sitting on my own
Did you have to treat me, oh, so bad?
All I do is hang my head and moan
[Chorus]
Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me
[Verse 2]
If it's something that I said or done
Tell me what and I'll apologize
If you don't, I really can't go on
Holding back these tears in my eyes
[Chorus]
Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried

Well, I beg you on my bended knees
If you'll only listen to my pleas
Is there anything I can do?
'Cause I really can't stand it, I'm so in love with you

Kill the Lights Lyrics
“Kill the Lights” is track #2 on Luke Bryan’s new album of the same name.  In this song, he is taking his girlfriend out in the country, up a back road, to kill the lights, as the title implies, and make out.
[Verse 1]
High beams, you and me
Little back road, barely see
Right song, radio
Throw it in low and drive slow
I saw you and it lit me up
A girl like you, it's just too much
[Chorus]
Kill the lights, kill the lights
You can take me there tonight
We can make some sparks fly
We can make the dark cry
Feel the ride, take me high
The yellow moon in your eyes
Lost in your slow stare
In the middle of nowhere
Skin on skin, don't care where we've been
Pull me in and kill the lights
[Instrumental break]
[Verse 2]
We can feel our way through
Let me just hold on to you
Baby trust my hands
Live it up while we still can and[Chorus]
Kill the lights, kill the lights
You can take me there tonight
We can make some sparks fly
We can make the dark cry
Feel the ride, take me high
The yellow moon in your eyes
Lost in your slow stare
In the middle of nowhere
Skin on skin, don't care where we've been
Pull me in and kill the lights
[Bridge?]
Don't it feel right
Until the sunrise
We can just go on what we know
[Instrumental break]
[Verse 3]
Can't help but wanna want ya
You wanna do this don't ya
Come here, let me pull you closer
You reach over and
[Chorus]
Kill the lights, kill the lights
You can take me there tonight
We can make some sparks fly
We can make the dark cry
Feel the ride, take me high
The yellow moon in your eyes
Lost in your slow stare
In the middle of nowhere
Skin on skin, don't care where we've been
Skin on skin, don't care where we've been
Pull me in and kill the lights[Outro]
Kill the lights
Baby you and me, kill the lights

[Verse 1]
We gather here, we line up, weepin' in a sunlit room
And if I'm on fire, you'll be made of ashes, too
Even on my worst day, did I deserve, babe
All the hell you gave me?
'Cause I loved you, I swear I loved you
'Til my dying day
[Chorus]
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And you're the hero flying around, saving face
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet
[Verse 2]
We gather stones, never knowing what they'll mean
Some to throw, some to make a diamond ring
You know I didn't want to have to haunt you
But what a ghostly scene
You wear the same jewels that I gave you
As you bury me
[Chorus]
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet[Bridge]
And I can go anywhere I want
Anywhere I want, just not home
And you can aim for my heart, go for blood
But you would still miss me in your bones
And I still talk to you (When I'm screaming at the sky)
And when you can't sleep at night
 
(You hear my stolen lullabies)
[Chorus]
I 
didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
You turned into your worst fears
And you're tossing out blame, drunk on this pain
Crossing out the good years
And you're cursing my name, wishing I stayed

Some fans believe it connects to Swift’s personal life as well — with the song really being about Scott Borchetta’s betrayal of Swift when she left Big Machine records for Republic.

In addition, on August 2017’s “Look What You Made Me Do,” Swift infamously proclaimed “the old Taylor” dead. The prominent funeral imagery makes it sound like Swift may be mourning this metaphorical murder.

This song was confirmed on Taylor’s social media accounts on July 23, 2020. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Swift/_/mY+tEArS+rICOchEt"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."

Blue Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I was always blue behind the
Red bloodstain on my lips
You were always green with envy
Saw right through the tenderness
We were like a California sunset
Fated to die any minute
Gettin' rid of you might be the best thing I ever did
[Pre-Chorus]
And I was seein' us in a silent movie
Takin' off our gloves like a violent crime scene
Diamonds in the cut always know how to fool me
Oh, honey
[Chorus]
But I know when to run, run, run
I know when to run, run, run
I know when to run, run, run
When my makeup does, when my makeup does
And I know when to run, run, run
I know when to run, run
And I know when to run, run, run
When my makeup does, when my makeup does
[Verse 2]
I was always blue behind the
Black mascara that I cried
You could be as sweet as honey
But I knew the darkness in your mind
We were like a gorgeous bed of roses
Ready to die any minute
Gettin' rid of you might be the best thing I ever did[Pre-Chorus]
And I was seein' us in a silent movie
Takin' off our gloves like a violent crime scene
Diamonds in the cut always know how to fool me
Oh, honey

But I know when to run, run, run
I know when to run, run, run
I know when to run, run, run

[Verse 1]
Gotten too far off the map
Not so sure I can get back
Was I the one who drifted off?
Did I take advantage of good love?
'Cause I swear I did everything I could've done
But what good is love without the trust?
Does anybody wanna
[Chorus]
Put me back, put me back
On the map?
I'd be all about it
I'd do anything, anything
That you asked
'Cause, honestly, I've been
Out of touch and out of reach
Just looking for someone, anything
That's finally gonna put me back
Put me back on the map
[Verse 2]
Something steady, something good
It's probably closer than I thought it could be
All this off the grid, it's getting old
And my compass says I'm getting close
But I don't know, it's hard to read
So I'll just keep moving, hoping someone out there's gonna[Chorus]
Put me back, put me back

That's finally gonna put me back
Put me back on the map

S.O.S., it's out of hand
Just holding out for a love again
I'm sendin' signals, find me fast
I know, I know there's gotta be somebody who can

Put me back, put me back
On the map
'Cause I'd be all about it
I'd do anything, anything

It's not that I'm afraid I'm not enough for her
It's not that I can't find the words to say
But when she's with him, she seems happier
And I don't want to take that away
[Pre-Chorus]
How many times can I see your face?
How many times will you walk away?
I just have to let you know

I'm not tryna start a fire, with this flame
But I'm worried that your heart might feel the same

Emotional Bruises Lyrics
[Verse 1]
How do I word this?
Was about to write you this letter
But it was just curses in cursive
You probably deserve it
But that's so impersonal, should tell you in person
I hope it don't hurt you, but then, I've been hurt too by you
The truth is, all you do is
Leave me emotional bruises
[Pre-Chorus]
You're callin' me up to link up and figure shit out
No doubt, time's out, we never figure shit out
I can't do this no more, you got me on life support
[Chorus]
'Cause this is the fifth time I've taken you back
It's the fourth time that we've relapsed
It's the third second chance that I've given you
For the first time, let this be the last
Fifth time I've taken you back
It's the fourth time that I've collapsed into your arms
It's so hard, but for the best
For the first time, let this be the last
[Verse 2]
This vicious cycle, it's driving me psycho
I'm anxious, need someone to come check my vitals (Come check my vitals)
One minute, I'm leaving, the next, I forgive you[Pre-Chorus]
You're callin' me up to link up and figure shit out
No doubt, time's out, we never figure shit out
I can't do this no more, cutting off the life support

It's the fourth time that we've relapsed
It's the third second chance that I've given you

The track is Harry’s father’s favorite song on the album.

In an interview on BBC Radio 1, Harry stated:

""‘Carolina’ was the last song that I wrote for the album. It was kinda what felt like it finished it off. We had a week or two weeks, and it felt like we were in a funk. I wrote this and it felt like the bit of fun it was missing. It’s about a specific person, and they know it’s about them now. It’s potentially about someone from Carolina.""

Dancing for your pleasure

You are not to blame for
Bittersweet distractor
Dare not speak its name
Dedicated to all hu–
All human beings

Because we separate like ripples on a blank shore

Because we separate like ripples on a blank shore

Take me with you
Dedicated to all hu–
All human beings",https://genius.com/Radiohead-reckoner-lyrics,"This song was first played at the Gorge in George, WA on June 23, 2001.

Reckoner is reminiscent of a line from the opening of Book II from Goethe’s Faust, “Life is not light but the refracted color.” The meaning is that life is not pure, but mixed, like rainbows. Radiohead’s album title, “In Rainbows,” and this song from which it comes, suggest there are deals made and reckonings to be made by the life we live. These deals mean we live multiple lives, not a singular or pure one. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/_/Reckoner"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","This song was first played at the Gorge in George, WA on June 23, 2001.

Radiohead’s album title, “In Rainbows,” and this song from which it comes, suggest there are deals made and reckonings to be made by the life we live. These deals mean we live multiple lives, not a singular or pure one. Thus, as this song says: “Because we separate like/ripples on a blank shore.” That is to say, we fragment and in the fragmentation make and are “in rainbows.” We are clothed and bathed in the colors of life. This is the exit door from the moral dilemmas that would condemn us to hell for the choices we make, the inflexible codes that demand we live an impossibly pure life. It is redemption and is similar to the redemption of Faust at the end of the story, at least in Goethe’s version. Interestingly, the song preceding this one is called “Faust Arp.” This further leads listeners to think this interpretation is the intended one. Mephistopheles shows up in “Videotape,” which interestingly enough is a song about a kind of redemption. The album has the vague structure of the Faust story. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/_/Reckoner"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Homesick Lyrics
[Intro]
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
[Verse 1]
I always knew that you existed, no one listened
How come when you drove by, you wouldn't stop to visit?
My mom and dad said they first met under the moonlight
I didn't buy their cover story, it didn't feel right
'Cause I belong in space, floatin' with debris
Somethin' 'bout this place never did feel right to me
[Chorus]
Countin' the stars, they all felt so far
But it's always felt like home to me
What took you so long?
They thought that I was wrong
But now, they'll all see
They're all gonna see
That's where I'm meant to be
Now, they're all gonna see
It's where I'm meant to be[Verse 2]
And you're so lucky, lookin' down on everybody
Me, alone and fakin' at this afterparty
These ain't my people, ain't my crew, it ain't my planet
These humans speak my language, still don't understand it
I wish you took me with you when you left that day
And everything looks perfect when you're far away
[Chorus]
Countin' the stars, they all felt so far
But it's always felt like home to me
What took you so long?
They thought that I was wrong
But now, they'll all see
They're all gonna see
That's where I'm meant to be
Now, they're all gonna see
It's where I'm meant to be
[Chorus]
Countin' the stars, they all felt so far
But it's always felt like home to me
What took you so long?
They thought that I was wrong
But now, they'll all see
They're all gonna see
That's where I'm meant to be
Now, they're all gonna see
It's where I'm meant to be[Outro]
I put a spatially tessellated void inside a modified temporal field
Until a planet developed intelligent life
I then introduced that life to the wonders of electricity
Which they now generate on a global scale
And you know, some of it goes to power my engine and charge my phone and stuff
Rick, take us home, now
Alright, alright, fine, Morty",https://genius.com/Madison-beer-homesick-lyrics,"""Homesick"" is the ninth track of Madison Beer's debut studio album, Life Support. It was released on February 26, 2021 through Epic Records.

The way you whisper slow

Camila summarised the track in Spotify’s “The Romance Experience”: ""It’s like the person you don’t wanna like. ‘Cause you know that he would just mess me up, and my stomach would be in knots. It just got to the point where it was funny because every time I’d be like, 'I don’t like him’ […] I knew I was just lying to myself.""

Musically, ""Liar"" is a pop song, which contains an ""island"", reggae, and pan-Caribbean and Spanish mélange influences. The jazz-tinged song – which samples Ace Of Base’s 90s hit “All That She Wants”“ and Lionel Richie’s 1983 song “All Night Long (All Night)”–finds Camila losing control as she falls in love, despite denying her feelings. ""Liar"" opens with a combination of trumpets, dance-based bass drums, and mariachi-inspired horns. Elements of Latin trap and flamenco are accompanied by electronic handclaps, which leads to the ska-pop chorus.

Step Off Lyrics
A “sublime anti-bitch smack down” according to GQ magazine, Kacey Musgraves gets sassy and tells off any negative people.
[Verse 1]
You sure look real pretty in your glass house
You probably think you're too good to take the trash out
Well, are you dumb? Are you blind?
'Cause it's a real fine line
Between tellin' a joke and turning the knife
Don't wreck my reputation
Let me wreck my own
[Chorus]
Step off, step off
Yeah, you're getting too close to me
With all your negativity
Just get lost
Just try to make a little difference
Here's why you gotta interfere
Just keep climbing that mountain of dirty tricks
And when you finally get to the top
Step off, yeah
[Verse 2]
You screwed everybody over in this town
'Cause there ain't nothing between you and the cold, hard ground
Keep running your mouth and stretching the truth
You just might find a hole in your parachute
'Cause whatever gets you high
Will always bring you down[Chorus]
So step off, step off
Yeah, you're getting too close to me
With all your negativity
Just get lost
Just try to make a little difference
Here's why you gotta interfere
Just keep climbing that mountain of dirty tricks, yeah
And when you finally get to the top
Mm, step off
[Bridge]
Sticks and stones may build a throne (
Ah, ah
)
But you'll be up there all alone
So step off
Yeah, yeah
Step off

And keep climbing that mountain of dirty tricks, yeah
When you finally get to the top
Step off
Mm, just step off

[Verse 1]
Boy, I know you can't help but to be yourself 'round me
Yourself 'round me, no
And I know nobody's perfect, so I'll let you be
I'll let you be
It's the way you wear your emotions on both of your sleeves, oh
To the face you make when I tell you that I have to leave, ooh
[Chorus]
But I like it, baby
Ooh, I like it, baby
But I like it, baby, baby
But I like it, baby
[Verse 2]
Oh, we don't need the world's acceptance, they're too hard on me
They're too hard on you, boy
I'll always be your secret weapon in your arsenal, your arsenal
And I know you had it rough growin' up, but that's okay (That's okay, baby)
I like it rough (That's okay, baby)
Even when you let your feelings get in the way (Let your feelings get in the way)
[Chorus]
I still like it, baby
Ooh, I like it, baby (Like it, baby)
But I like it, baby (Like it, baby)
Baby, baby (Like it, baby)
I still like it, baby
Baby, baby, baby[Bridge]
Say, say you won't change
I love the little things that make you you
Ooh, the rest of the world is strange, stay in our lane
Just you and me and our family
I think you're so cool
(Even though I'm cooler than you)
[Verse 3]
Boy, I love that you can't help but be yourself around me
Yourself around me
Sugar, well, you're trippin', I know we'll make up and make love
So I'll let you be
I'll let you be
It's the way you listen when I'm cryin', you let me lean in
It's the way you want one more kiss after you said you were leaving
[Chorus]
But I like it, baby (Yes, I like it, baby)
Babe (Yes, I like it, baby)
Yes, I like it, baby (Like it, baby)
Like it (Like it), I like it
I love it, baby
I like it, baby
I like it, I love it, baby
I like it, baby, yeah, I like it, oh, like it
I like it, yeah
I like, I like it, baby
I like it, baby[Outro]
I like it, baby
Baby, come on over
Ooh, I like it, baby

Didn't we? Didn't we?

You know? I'm stronger than I think
Usually, I'd join you on the floor, but this dance ain't for me
Boy, just turn the music up
Maybe someday, we'll look back with love
Didn't think you'd lose me
Now it's just too late to choose me

JUST FOR FUN Lyrics

I'm goin' all out just for fun, I am the man, I know it
And everywhere I go, they know my name
So I laugh and I lie and the coyotes cry
And, uh, time moves quickly and so do I, so do I
So I'll say my goodbye

'Cause time heals everything
I don't need anything
Hallelujah
I pray to her

Here's to hoping I'll fall fast asleep tonight
And I'll just need to get through this
Born in the darkness, who brings the light?
And I just, I need to get through this
Or just get used to it

You Should Probably Leave Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I know it ain't all that late
But you should probably leave
And I recognize that look in your eyes
Yeah, you should probably leave
[Chorus]
'Cause I know you and you know me
And we both know where this is gonna lead
You want me to say that I want you to stay
So you should probably leave
Yeah, you should probably leave

There's still time for you to finish your wine
Then you should probably leave
And it's hard to resist, alright, just one kiss
Then you should probably leave

And we both know where this is gonna lead
You want me to say that I want you to stay
So you should probably leave

And it's gettin' kinda hard for me to do the right thing here
I wanna do the right thing, baby

And I been watchin' you sleep
And honey, I'm so afraid you're gonna wake up and say

[Verse 1]
The markings on your surface
Your speckled face
Flawed crystals hang from your ears
I couldn't gauge your fears
I can't relate to my peers
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather chip my pride than lose my mind out here
Maybe I'm a fool
Maybe I should move and settle
Two kids and a swimming pool
I'm not brave (Brave)
I'm not brave
[Verse 2]
I'm living over city
And taking in the homeless sometimes, I've
Been living in an idea
An idea from another man's mind
Maybe I'm a fool
To settle for a place with some nice views (Nice views)
Maybe I should move, settle down
Two kids and a swimming pool
I'm not brave
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather go to jail
I've tried hell (It's a loop)
What would you recommend I do? (And the other side of the loop is a loop)
This, this fe—, this feel, this feel, this feels
This feels how molly must feel
This feels how molly must feel
How molly must feel
This feels how molly must feel
How molly must feel[Bridge]
This is not my life
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
This is not my life
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
It's not what I'm like
It's just a fond farewell (Brave)
[Verse 3]
Speaking of Nirvana, it was there
Rare as the feathers on my dash from a phoenix
There with my crooked teeth and companion sleeping, yeah
Dreaming a thought that could dream about a thought
That could think of the dreamer that thought
That could think of dreaming and getting a glimmer of God
I be dreaming of dreaming a thought
That could dream about a thought
That could think of dreaming a dream
Where I cannot, where I cannot
[Verse 4]
Less morose and more present
Dwell on my gifts for a second, a moment
One solar flare, we're consumed
So why not spend this flammable paper on the film that's my life?
High flights, inhale the vapor, exhale once and think twice
Eat some shrooms, maybe have a good cry about you
See some colors, light hang glide off the moon[Outro]
In the dark, in the dark
I'd do anything for you (In the dark)
I'd do anything for you (In the dark)
I'd do anything for you (In the dark)
I'd do anything for you (In the dark)
I'd do anything for you, anything for you (In the dark)
I'd do anything for you, anything for you",https://genius.com/Frank-ocean-seigfried-lyrics,"“Seigfried,” the fifteenth track on Frank Ocean’s Blonde, might be called a metaphysical break-up song.

The hero Siegfried of Norse mythology is often depicted as a handsome man with long, flowing hair, much like Cartier.

Based on the mention of “a speckled face”, the song may be about male model Willy Cartier, who’s rumored to have had a brief affair with Ocean. The hero Siegfried of Norse mythology is often depicted as a handsome man with long, flowing hair, much like Cartier.

The narrative of the song is difficult to follow, but seems to have a recognizable structure nonetheless. The song moves from his love life, to his inner life, and then back out to his love life. In the first verse Frank begins by addressing a lover in a failed romance and goes to reflect on his own life. Frank’s reflections become increasingly more penetrating: they move from wondering about his life choices and then transition to thoughts about the nature of his own mind and God. The song then seems to move back into a consideration of lost love and ends with a declaration “I’d do anything for you.”

The title appears to be a spelling variation on the Germanic name Siegfried, which is composed of the roots sig, meaning victory, and frithu, meaning peace. The name “Siegfried” has several cultural resonances Frank may be channeling:

Siegfried is a warrior in Norse mythology. In folklore, Siegfried slays the dragon Fafnir and wins the princess Brünnhilde. He is considered an archetypal figure of bravery. Siegfried was popularized through the operas of Richard Wagner (1813-1883), specifically his four-part work Der Ring des Nibelungen.

The song may also make reference to Siegfried Sassoon; a British war poet who had a number of homosexual and heterosexual affairs and encounters, echoing Frank’s own bisexuality. Siegfried Sassoon was a soldier – possibly the reason Frank repeatedly mentions being or not being brave. Also, Siegfried had a close friend by the name of Wilfred Owen. Wilfred had fallen madly in love with Siegfried and wrote many love letters to him. Frank may be relating himself and the situation he describes in the song to Wilfred Owen.

Siegfried is a character from the Soul Calibur series. “Soul Calibur” was a track from Ocean’s mixtape, nostalgia, ULTRA.

Frank premiered “Siegfried” on his European Tour, ‘California Live,’ at the BMW Welt in Munich back in June 2013. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Frank+Ocean/_/Seigfried"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Ghetto Symphony Lyrics
[Intro]
(
I, I-I love you
)
[Chorus]
New bitch from Italy (Beep, beep), too much swag
I'm like, ""Look what fashion did to me,"" iced out chain
Now the opps tryna mimic me
Real block boy, but the whole world mention me
Bands in the Distro, label can't steal from me
Racks too long, look like Human Centipede
Came a long way, this a ghetto symphony (
Falcon Punch
)
[Verse]
She fuck with me 'cause I'm differently (She fuck with me)
Bitch too cold like I got diseases
Talk my shit, I don't do no singing
I'm too rich for school, I said, ""Fuck the thesis"" (
Falcon Punch
)
All I need is slime, I don't do the leaches (Slime)
'Member I was broke, now I ice my pieces (Let's go)
You wanna get rich? I could fuckin' teach it
You wanna get rich? I could, yeah, I could
I'm tryna fuck with your friend, don't be a cock blocker
She ain't gon' give it up too easy, that's what pops taught her (
No way
)
Good thing I'm smooth with it, yeah, I'm a panty dropper (Dropper)
She goin' through my followin', I'ma fuckin' block her
I'm stackin' all these commas so I could fuck your daughter
I grew up in the trench, now I'm in the Bahamas
My money talkin' loud, I can't even hear no drama (Drama)[Chorus]
New bitch from Italy (Beep, beep), too much swag
I'm like, ""Look what fashion did to me,"" iced out chain
Now the opps tryna mimic me (

You see me standing, but I'm dying on the floor
Stone cold, stone cold
Maybe if I don't cry, I won't feel anymore

Am I doin' enough? (Enough)
Feel like I'm wastin' time, oh, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
Promise to get a little better as I get older
And you're so patient, you're sick of waitin'
Promise to do better
Should've, could've, probably wanna let me go

But lately you've been feelin' so good
I forget my future, never pull out
(Sh-sh-shame, Sh-sh-shame on me)
Baby, the money'll make it easier for me
To run and hide out somewhere

Hoppin' through poppy fields
Dodgin' evil witches
These houses keep droppin' everywhere

Sometimes I get a little too hurt
Got my mind goin' places it ain't wanna go
Sometimes I get a little too low
And I can't see myself through the fire and smoke
And you, like a neon light
Shinin' through a door that I can't keep closed
And you, like a rolling stone
Always buildin' cities on the hearts that you broke
[Chorus]
And in my head, I did my very best saying goodbye, goodbye
And I don't miss you, but I think of you and don't know why
I still feel high
I still feel high
[Verse 2]
Sometimes I stay up all night
'Cause you don't ever talk to me in my dreams
And I think about eventually you're holdin' me
And dancin' to the record like a movie scene
[Chorus]
And in my head, I did my very best saying goodbye, goodbye
And I don't miss you, but I think of you and don't know why
I still feel high
I still feel high[Bridge]

[Intro]
Marks on that freeway
Marks on that freeway
Alright, uh
[Verse 1]
If I was bein' honest
I'd say long as I could fuck three times a day and not skip a meal, I'm good
I used to work on my feet for seven dollars a hour
Call my mama like, ""Mama
I ain't makin' minimum wage, mama
I'm on, mama, I'm on
Now I'm makin' 400, 600, 800K, mama
To stand on my feet, mama
Play these songs, it's therapy, mama
They payin' me, mama
I should be payin' them""
I should be payin' y'all, honest to God
I'm just a guy, I'm not a god
Sometimes I feel like I'm a god, but I'm not a god
If I was, I don't know which heaven would have me, mama
Let me run this bitch, I'ma run it into the ground, mama, the whole galaxy
Goddamn, fuck these lames, they don't want none
Fuck these lames, they don't want none
Fuck these niggas
Fuck these niggas, they don't want none
Fuck these niggas
Fuck you, nigga, and
Fuck me if I hated on you[Verse 2]
I'ma stick around
I'm gon' let my nuts hang
Nigga, you got some just like me, don't you?
Or maybe not just like me
You know I'm Africano Americano
And even if you're half Japanese, roots run deep
Family tree throw a big shadow (Jammin' to the rhythm)
Tech company, please give me immortality
 (It's a face to face)
I'm goin' rapidly, fadin' drastically
 
(Keep me high, castrati)
Damn
 
(Punani fade the stress)
Or pull the zip down
Wet your lips first, lick the tip now
 
(Bugatti left some stretch marks on that freeway)
Smoke somethin'
 
(Marks on that freeway)
They tryna find 2Pac
Don't let 'em find 2Pac
He evade the press
He escape the stress
La, da-da-da
La, da-da-da
La, da-da-da
[Verse 3]
I'll keep quiet and let you run your phone bill up
I know you love to talk
I ain't on your schedule
I ain't on no schedule
I ain't had me a job since 2009
I ain't on no sales floor
You say I'm changin' on you,
 
I feel like Selena
They wanna murder a nigga, murder me like Selena
You must ain't get the memo
I don't cuff bitches no more
But your bitch my exception
Come get her outta my four-door
I only got one four-door
Remember when I had that Lexus? No
Our friendship don't go back that far
Tyler slept on my sofa, yeah
Niggas go back that far
I ain't smoked all year
This the last song, so I'm finna wipe that off
Tolerance is so low, still smoke a whole 'gar
Ménage on my birthday, tap out on the first stroke
'Cause this ain't no work day, she don't give head anyway
'Cause what niggas say, that's what she tell her man
What a difference distance makes
Niggas wan' fight in the streets now, shit startin' to make my hands hurt
Jay hit me on the email, said I oughta act my net worth
Dog, this is chess now, not fetch, I ain't runnin' for a nigga
Ain't ran since track meets, that's the only time I ran from a nigga
You can change this track now, could've changed this bitch a long time ago
—know and —know, —know and —know
Shout out to Hollygrove, I'm from that 7th, though
Twins know and Lance know, Clark know and 
Matt know
Shit went one-eighty on me, please run that back, though

You say some shit about me? Tell the real story, my nigga (That shit happened a second time?)

That second time, Jerron was there, nigga
On God, he grabbed me in circles, nigga
And the, and then the nigga tried to boom me— (Oh yeah, Jerron told me you that your ass, especially told me)

[Verse 1]
Late on a Tuesday, I saw your picture
You were so happy, I could just tell
She's really pretty, I think she's a model
Baby, together, you look hot as hell
[Pre-Chorus]
And I didn't even want to cry (Oh, what is this feeling?)
Couldn't believe it, had to ask myself why
[Chorus]
I must've loved you more than I ever knew
(Didn't know I could ever feel)
'Cause I'm happy for you
(Now I know everything was real)
I'm not mad, I'm not hurt
You got everything you deserve
Oh, I must've loved you more than I ever knew
I'm happy for you
[Verse 2]
And looking back now, I hope you see it
Even the hard parts were all for the best
I see where you're at now, you picked up the pieces
And then you gave them to somebody else[Pre-Chorus]
And I didn't even want to cry (Oh, what is this feeling?)
Couldn't believe it, had to ask myself why
[Chorus]
I must've loved you more than I ever knew
(Didn't know I could ever feel)
'Cause I'm happy for you
(Now I know everything was real)
I'm not mad, I'm not hurt
You got everything you deserve
Oh, I must've loved you more than I ever knew
I'm happy for you
[Bridge]
You, you, you (I'm happy for you)
You, you, you (Hope you're happy too)
[Chorus]
Oh, I must've loved you more than I ever knew (Ooh)
(Didn't know I could ever feel)
'Cause I'm happy for you
(Now I know everything was real)
I'm not mad (I'm not mad), I'm not hurt (I'm not hurt)
You got everything you deserve
Oh, I must've loved you more than I ever knew (Ooh)
I'm happy for you[Outro]

[Intro]
Oh, yeah
[Verse 1]
Wake up in my bed, I just wanna have a good day (Mmm, ah)
Think it in my head, then it happens how it should, ayy
Twelve o'clock, I got a team meeting, 
then a meditation at like 1:30
Then I ride to the studio listening to some shit I wrote (Oh)
[Pre-Chorus]
Good karma, my aesthetic (Aesthetic)
Keep my conscience clear, that's why I'm so magnetic
Manifest it (Yeah), I finessed it (I finessed it)
Take my pen and write some love letters to Heaven

Middle finger to my thumb and then I snap it
Just like magic (Yeah), I'm attractive (Oh yeah)
I get everything I want 'cause I attract it (Oh)
[Verse 2]
Looking at my phone, but I'm tryna disconnect it (Oh yeah)
Read a fuckin' book, I be tryna stay connected (Yeah)
Say it's tricky at the top, gotta keep a slim ego for a thick wallet
Losing friends left and right, but I just send 'em love and light (Oh)[Pre-Chorus]
Good karma, my aesthetic (My aesthetic)
Keep my conscience clear, that's why I'm so magnetic
Manifest it (Ooh), I finessed it (Ooh)

Just like magic, I'm attractive
I get everything I want 'cause I attract it

One Margarita Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Everybody here ain't from here
But we're here doin' our thing
Lettin' go a little, little by little
Sippin' on a frozen drink
[Pre-Chorus]
Tiki bars tik'n, pourin' all weekend
Clouds ain't leakin' no rain
Two pieces shakin', white caps a-breakin'
We ain't feelin' no pain, it goes like
[Chorus]
One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, shot
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow, leave all your sorrow out here on the floatin' dock
When that sun lays down, we'll be on our way
One more barefoot round, one more last chance to say
""Hey, señorita, don't you think we need a salt and a Buffett song?""
One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, we'll be gone
[Verse 2]
Ice blue skies, shades on the eyes
To tuck the bloodshot away
Hair of the dog, shouldn't take long
But who cares, we got all day
Palm trees a-leanin', sunburn screamin'
But we'll all be alright, after[Chorus]
One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, shot
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow, leave all your sorrow out here on the floatin' dock
When that sun lays down, we'll be on our way
One more barefoot round, one more last chance to say
""Hey, señorita, don't you think we need a salt and a Marley song?""
One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, we'll be gone
[Post-Chorus]
We'll be gone
[Pre-Chorus]
Tiki bars tik'n, pourin' all weekend
Clouds ain't leakin' no rain
Two pieces shakin', white caps a-breakin'
We ain't feelin' no pain, feelin' no pain
It goes like

One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, shot
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow, leave all your sorrow out here on the floatin' dock
When that sun lays down, we'll be on our way
One more barefoot round, one more last chance to say

Bryan's bandleader Michael Carter wrote the song with Josh Thompson and Matt Dragstrem.

Wendy Hermanson of the blog Taste of Country wrote of the song that it is a ""light, sparkling, feel-good number dedicated to a bit of old-fashioned hedonism that has Bryan counting 'One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, we'll be gone,' and name-dropping Bob Marley, Jimmy Buffett, and Kenny Chesney. A mariachi band helps the vibe along, and everyone has plenty of smiles to spare. Jon Freeman of Rolling Stone Country wrote that the song has an ""equally buoyant melody and groove that’s punctuated by mandolin and peals of Hammond organ. Bryan, who’s no stranger to a party song, looks at the bigger picture of vacation as escape from the stress and anxiety of everyday existence."" Bryan's bandleader, Michael Carter, wrote the song with Josh Thompson and Matt Dragstrem. The song was officially released to radio on April 13, 2020. It is the album's third single, following ""Knockin' Boots"" and ""What She Wants Tonight"".

The song's music video was directed by Michael Monaco. It features Bryan ""cavorting on the beach"". Bryan's wife, Caroline, and mother, LeClaire, make guest appearances, as do Caylee Hammack and members of Old Dominion. Bryan filmed the video during Crash My Playa, an annual beach party he holds in Mexico, in January 2020 prior to the song's release. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Luke+Bryan/_/One+Margarita"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

[Verse 1]
Remember how we used to party up all night?
Sneakin' out, lookin' for a taste of real life
Drinkin' in the small town firelight
(Pabst Blue Ribbon on ice)
Sweet sixteen and we had arrived
Walkin' down the streets as they whistle, ""Hi, hi""
Stealin' police cars with the senior guys
Teachers said we'd never make it out alive
[Pre-Chorus]
There she was, my new best friend
High heels in her hand, swayin' in the wind
Oh, she starts to cry, mascara runnin' down her little Bambi eyes
""Lana, how I hate those guys""
[Chorus]
This is what makes us girls
We all look for heaven and we put love first
Somethin' that we'd die for, it's a curse
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it
This is what makes us girls
We don't stick together 'cause we put love first
Don't cry about him, don't cry about him
It's all gonna happen[Verse 2]
And that's where the beginning of the end begun
Everybody knew that we had too much fun
We were skippin' school and drinkin' on the job with the boss
Sweet sixteen and we had arrived
Baby's table dancin' at the local dive
Cheerin' our names in the pink spotlight
Drinkin' Cherry Schnapps in the velvet night
[Pre-Chorus]
Yo, we used to go break into the hotel
Glimmerin', we'd swim
Runnin' from the cops in our black bikini tops
Screamin', ""Get us while we're hot, get us while we're hot""
(C'mon, take a shot)
[Chorus]
This is what makes us girls
We all look for heaven and we put love first
Somethin' that we'd die for, it's a curse
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it
This is what makes us girls
We don't stick together 'cause we put love first
Don't cry about him, don't cry about him
It's all gonna happen[Bridge]
The prettiest in-crowd that you had ever seen
Ribbons in our hair and our eyes gleamed mean
A freshmen generation of degenerate beauty queens
And you know somethin'?
[Verse 3]
They were the only friends I ever had
We got into trouble and when stuff got bad
I got sent away, I was wavin' on the train platform
Cryin' 'cause I know I'm never comin' back
[Chorus]
This is what makes us girls
We all look for heaven and we put love first
Somethin' that we'd die for, it's a curse
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it

The focus then shifts to the friendship between the narrator and her new best friend, who cries about some guys who have hurt her. The chorus repeats the phrase ""this is what makes us girls"" as a refrain, emphasizing the idea that their pursuit of love and happiness is what defines them as young women. They are willing to put love first, even if it means they might suffer for it, as seen in the line ""Something that we'd die for, it's a curse"".

As the song progresses, the behavior of the girls becomes more extreme, such as skipping school and drinking on the job. However, the bond between them remains strong, and they continue to look out for each other. The bridge describes them as the ""prettiest in-crowd"" and ""degenerate beauty queens"", highlighting their beauty and rebelliousness.

The song ends with the realization that their reckless behavior has consequences, as the narrator is sent away and forced to leave her friends behind. Despite this, the chorus repeats the idea that their pursuit of love and happiness is what defines them and sets them apart from others.

Overall, ""This Is What Makes Us Girls"" is a nostalgic and bittersweet reflection on the power of female friendship and the desire to feel alive and loved as a young woman.

It is the twelfth and final track from the standard version of Lana Del Rey's second studio album and major-label debut, Born to Die. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Lana+Del+Rey/_/This+Is+What+Makes+Us+Girls"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Lost in Paradise Lyrics
[Verse 1]
What am I supposed to do with this heart?
(With this heart, with this heart)
How do I take it off if I love at all?
It's like a work of art
In love, we all will fall, but
We fell a little harder
What am I supposed to do with this heart?
(With this heart, with this heart)
It may be wrong, but it feels right
To be lost in paradise
[Chorus]
I'm so lost in paradise
If I open up my eyes
I can see the storm, I can see the sky
I can see the darkness, flashing lights
All my fears, gone tonight
Let me stay
I'm lost in paradise
(Bass slap)
[Verse 2]
How was I to know that my love was delusional?
Somebody told me how to mend
A broken-hearted soul
In love, we all will fall, but
We fell a little harder
What am I supposed to do with this heart?
(With this heart, with this heart)
It may be wrong, but it feels right
To be lost in paradise[Chorus]
I'm so lost in paradise (Lost in paradise)

I got a new dress just to meet you downtown
Can you walk me through the park just to show it off?
I can pull my hair back in that tight way that you like
If you wrap me in your arms and never stop

Heart beats so loud that it's drownin’ me out

You could be the one, have the honor of my babies
Hope they have your eyes and that crooked smile

So low that I can see under the skirt of an ant
So low that I don't get high no more
When I ""Geronimo,"" I just go, ""Heh""
Solo, my cup is a rojo, my cholo, my friend
So low that I can admit
When I hear that another kid is shot by the popo
It ain't an event no more
So low that no more high horses, so hard to wear Polo
When I do, I cut the pony off
Now there's a hole where there once was a logo, how fitting
So low that I can give a fuck about what is trending
Tryna cut down on my spending
Regardless of winning, instead of pretending
And bending over backwards
Over half of these hoes had work done
Sayin' they want something real from a man
Just saying it, we being real persons
I hate that it's like this, I feel for you, ant
I don't know what it's like with a skirt on
So pardon me if I am being insensitive
But darling, this only worsens
So low my halo stay way low, it feels like it's bent
So low that when they throw pussy or pesos
Don't pay no attention to it
So low that I am no rookie, but feel like a kid
Lookin' at the other kids
With astonishment while I'm on punishment
Watchin' the summer come close to an end

[Verse 1]
She had a cross around her neck
And a flower in her hand
That I picked from the side of Thomas Drive
On our way to the sand
We found an old wooden chair
Still warm from the sun
Pushed it back, gave me a kiss with Bacardi on her lips
And I was done
[Chorus]
And we spent that week wide open
Upside down beside the ocean
I didn't know where it was goin'
Just tryin' to keep my heart on the tracks
I should've known that kind of feelin'
Would last longer than that week did
Blown away and barely breathin'
Sunday came and it was over
Now she's got me twisted
Like an old beach roller coaster
[Verse 2]
The rest of those days
Turned into long crazy nights
When the music got loud
We'd sneak away from the crowd
Under the boardwalk lights
And with all the things we said
What I just can't get past
Is the way we let it end
Now I'm wonderin' where she is
Knowin' I can't get that goodbye back[Chorus]
We spent that week wide open
Upside down beside the ocean
I didn't know where it was goin'
Just tryin' to keep my heart on the tracks
I should've known that kind of feelin'
Would last longer than that week did
Blown away and barely breathin'
When Sunday came and it was over
Now she's got me twisted
Like an old beach roller coaster
[Bridge]
She's like a song playin' over and over
In my mind, where I still hold her
I had the chance and I should've told her
[Chorus]
When we spent that week wide open
Upside down beside the ocean
I should've known where it was goin'
Still tryin' to keep my heart on the tracks
And I should've known that kind of feelin'
Would last longer than that week did
Blown away and barely breathin'
When Sunday came and it was over
Now she's got me twisted
Yeah, I'm still twisted

[Verse 1]
How can it be? You and me
Might be meant to be, can't unsee it
But I don't wanna cause no scene
I'm usually so unproblematic
So independent, tell me why
'Cause the boy is mine, mine
[Pre-Chorus]
Somethin' about him is made for somebody like me
Baby, come over, come over (Over)
And God knows I'm tryin', but there's just no use in denying

The boy is mine
I can't wait to try him

The stars, they aligned
Thе boy is mine
Watch me take my timе
I can't believe my mind
The boy is divine
Boy is mine
[Verse 2]
Please know this ain't what I planned for
Probably wouldn't bet a dime or my life on
There's gotta be a reason why
My girls, they always come through in a sticky situation
Say, ""It's fine"" (It's fine)
Happens all the time[Pre-Chorus]

Baby, come over, come over (Over)
And God knows I'm tryin', but there's just no use in denying

The boy is mine
I can't wait to try him
Le-let's get intertwined
The stars, they aligned
The boy is mine
Watch me take my time
I can't believe my mind
The boy is divine
Boy is—
[Bridge]
And I know it's simply meant to be
And I, I take full accountability for all these tears
Promise you, I'm not usually like this
Shit, it's like news to me, to me
But I can't ignore my heart, boy
[Chorus]
The boy is mine
I can't wait to try him (Oh, yeah)
Le-let's get intertwined
The stars, they aligned

Yeah

Sunday morning rain is falling
Steal some covers, share some skin (Like that)
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the mold that I am in
[Pre-Chorus 1]
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do (Life is hard)
And I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew
That someday, it would lead me back to you
That someday, it would lead me back to you (Someday)

That may be all I'll need
In darkness, she is all I see (All I see)
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

(Yeah) Paint a picture with my hands (Oh, oh, woah)
Back and forth, we sway like branches in a storm
Change the weather, still together when it ends[Chorus]
That may be all I'll need (All I'll need)
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do (Life gets hard)
Sunday morning rain is falling and I'm calling out to you
Singing, ""someday it will bring me back to you"", yeah
(Someday, oh, someday, oh)
Find a way to bring myself back home to you

And you may not know
That may be all I'll need (All I need)

Move Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Your mama packed y'all up and moved you to the south
Backed a U-Haul cross a one-tree yard
To a tin roof shotgun house
You didn't know nobody, didn't talk too much
Had a rocking little body with a yankee strut
A little shy side, a little wild side
With your long blonde hair all pulled up
Then you got in with some southern belles
Cut your jeans off with a rebel yell
Learned the talk of the Bible belt
Now, girl, I melt when you
[Chorus]
M-O-V-E, I love it
Yeah, I love it when you get that beat
Boots on, stomp your feet
It's like you've been waiting all week
Move like you do
All sexy and smooth
Like you love to
Oh, girl, look at you
Legs and your hips
Live oak moonlit
When that song hits
Damn, you turn it loose
Stars of the southern sky
Buzz of the fire and ice
DJ plays that throwback tune
But I can't move when you move[Verse 2]
It's like there's something in the air
That turns you wild when a country song
Is way up loud and the sun goes down
Right about then, you lock eyes on me
You got me where you want me, where I wanna be
All up in the middle of your left and right
Just side to side, yeah, you're right on time when you
[Chorus]
M-O-V-E, I love it
Yeah, I love it when you get that beat
Boots on, stomp your feet
It's like you've been waiting all week
Move like you do
All sexy and smooth
Like you love to
Oh, girl, look at you
Legs and your hips
Live oak moonlit
When that song hits
Damn, you turn it loose
Stars of the southern sky
Buzz of the fire and ice
DJ plays that throwback tune
And I can't move when you move[Bridge]
Let me talk to you
M-O-V-E
I love it when you, love it when you feel the beat
C-O-M-E
Come on, I wanna see you
[Chorus]
Move like you do
All sexy and smooth
Like you love to
Oh, girl, look at you
Legs and your hips
Live oak moonlit
When that song hits
Damn, you turn it loose
Stars of the southern sky
Buzz of the fire and ice
DJ playing throwback tunes
I wanna move when you

[Chorus: Really Doe]
You motherfuckers better do your job and roll up
And watch how we roll up,
 and
I can't control it, can't hold it, it's so nuts
I take a sip of that 'gnac, I wanna fuck
I take a hit of that chronic, it got me stuck
But really, what's amazing is how I keep blazing
Towel under the door, we smoke until the day's end
Puff-puff, then pass, don't fuck up rotation
Hpnotiq for Henny? Now, nigga, that's a chaser
Turn nothing to something, now, pimping, that's a savior
Best things are green, now, pimpin', get your paper
High off the ground, from stair to skyscraper
Cool out, thinking we local, c'mon, homie, we major
[Post-Chorus: Kanye West]
We major? C'mon, homie, we major
We major? C'mon, homie, we major
We major! C'mon, homie, we major
We major! C'mon
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Feeling better than some head on a Sunday afternoon
Better than a chick that say ""Yes"" too soon
Until you have a daughter; that's what I call karma
And you pray to God she don't grow breasts too soon
Projects tore up, gang signs is thrown up
Niggas hats broke off, that's how we grow up
Why else you think shorties write rhymes? Just to blow up?
Get they first car and then, IRS show up
He ain't never had shit, but he had that nine
Nigga come through flicking and he had that shine
Put two and two together and a little bad weather
Gon' be your whole family on that funeral line
Asked the reverend, ""Was the strip clubs cool?
If my tips helped send a pretty girl through school?""
That's all I want, like winos want they good whiskey
I ain't in the Klan, but I brought my hood with me[Chorus: Really Doe]
You motherfuckers better do your job and roll up
And watch how we roll up, and
I can't control it, can't hold it, it's so nuts
I take a sip of that 'gnac, I wanna fuck
I take a hit of that chronic, it got me stuck
But really, what's amazing is how I keep blazing

Puff puff, then pass, don't fuck up rotation

[Post-Chorus: Nas]
We major? C'mon, homie, we major
We major? C'mon, homie, we major
We major! C'mon, homie, we major
We major! C'mon, homie, we major
[Verse 2: Nas]
I heard the beat and I ain't know what to write
First line—should it be about the hoes or the ice?
Four-fours or Black Christ? Both flows'd be nice
Rap about big paper or the black man plight
At the studio console, asked my man to the right
""What this verse sound like? Should I freestyle or write?
He said, ""Nas, what the fans want is Illmatic, still""
Looked at the pad and pencil, and jotted what I feel
Been like twelve years since a nigga first signed
Now, I'm a free agent, and I'm thinking it's time
To build my very own Motown
'Cause rappers be deprived of executive nine-to-fives
And it hurts to see these companies be stealing the life
And I love to give my blood, sweat and tears to the mic
So y'all copped the LPs and y'all fiends got dealt
I'm Jesse Jackson on the balcony when King got killed
I survived the livest niggas around
Lasted longer than more than half of you clowns
Look, I used to cook before I had the game took
Either way, my change came like Sam Cooke[Refrain: Tony Williams & 
Nas
]
Bah-dah-bah-bah (
Yeah, yeah,
 yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
)
Feeling better than I ever felt before today
Like better late than never; it's orientation
Still, we can make it better, throwing all your cares away
Oh, oh, oh, ooh!
[Chorus: Really Doe & 
Tony Williams
]
You motherfuckers better do your job and roll up
And watch how we roll up, and (

I can't control it, I can't hold it, it's so nuts

Towel under the door, we smoke until the day's end
Puff-puff, then pass, don't fuck up rotation
Hpnotiq for Henny? Now, nigga, that's a chaser (
Oh, oh, oh, ooh!

Turn nothing to something, now, pimping, that's a savior (

Can I talk my shit again?
Can I talk my shit again?
I can't believe I'm back up in this motherfucker
I'ma be late, though
I gotta figure out what I'm finna wear
Yeah
The Roc is definitely in the building
G.O.O.D. Music's definitely in the building, ugh
I gotta say ""What's up"" to Tony Williams
On the vocals!
Sings—He sings quite beautifully, don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
Ugh
And Jon Brion on the keys right now
And Warryn Campbell on the keys right now
So they asked me:
""Why you call it 
Late Registration
, 'Ye?""
'Cause we takin' these motherfuckers back to school

The chorus is inspired by the idea of rising from the ground up; from the hood to the skyscraper and from nothing to something, everything is achievable through dedication and hard work. Throughout the song, the artists are encouraging people to stay strong, celebrate their successes and never give up on what they truly want. The song is ultimately a reminder that although life may be filled with struggles, with determination, anything is possible.

A cut off of Kanye’s Late Registration best known for Nas' verse. This helped close the gap between Jay-Z and Nas' feud, since Kanye and Jay are closely associated.

[Chorus: Kurupt]
Now this, this is one of them occasions
Where the homies not doin' it right
I mean he found him a ho that he like
But you can't make a ho a housewife
And when it all boils down you gonna find in the end
A bitch is a bitch, but a Dogg is a man's best friend
So what? You found you a ho that you like
But you can't make a ho a housewife (Wife)
[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
I mostly sold dick
 while I packed a gold clip
Worked my money-maker, she got paper, she 'bout to trip
(Where the fuck is my money?) I cannot G guilty
You pimpin' strong, but comin' home to sheets that be filthy
She on the dillzy, I take advantage
All up in them panties, I got this bitch speakin' Spanish
I'm mannish, get yo' nails out my back
Slut, I'm 'bout to nut and get up, go scrub yo' cat (Get the fuck out of here)
Learn the player rules, this is how a player do
Might not be a freak, but she got on the choosin' shoes
Dollar signs are folded, I can't control it
Tryin' to leave her, beeper just exploded
She sweatin' me, won't let me, broad turned fraud
Now she on this dick, huh, got her turnin' tricks, huh
Man, it's a trip, I don't trip, I'm in yo' 
Lexus flexin'
I left her up in Dallas, Texas, ass naked[Chorus]
Now this, this is one of them occasions
Where the homies not doin' it right
I mean he found him a ho that he like
But you can't make a ho a housewife
And when it all boils down you gonna find in the end
A bitch is a bitch, but a Dogg is a man's best friend
So what? You found you a ho that you like
But you can't make a ho a housewife (Wife)
[Verse 2: Hittman]
Naw, ""ho"" ain't short for honey, almost had to wail her like Bunny
Tellin' tales of bein' pregnant, catchin' Nordstrom sales with abortion money
I spotted her, seen her with my nigga when I shot at her
Now we got beef, he caught up in the ho's erotica
Exotic, she's psychotic, rockin' his Nautica
Soon he'll need antibiotics (Sucka bitch)
Name a sexual disease, she got it like Sam Goody
You be like, ""Damn, how could she hit me off with chlamydia?""
Fool, I pity ya
We live in the city of ballers
With more bounce and in a Zapp, she will doo wa ditty ya
The prettier the grittier, the wittier can get her
To the Hotel, Niko, 
on some Sauve shit like Rico
That's when I caught a Vision like Coleco
A high-post ho, a perfect way for me to keep dough
Huh, have her sellin' ass on Bronson Ave and Pico[Verse 3: Kurupt]
At the hotel, motel, or the Holiday Inn
 
(Say what, nigga?)
I said if that bitch keep fuckin' up (Beotch) then we'll fuck her friends
I said I dip, dive, what can I say?
Niggas need to stop fuckin' with O.J
Some niggas bang Blood, some niggas bang Crip
And bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
I had a dream of hoes, I had to screen my hoes
I seen my hoes in all kinds of clothes
Lil' Almond Joy, I truly enjoy
If you blew my balls right through my drawers
Come back to the mansion, chill at the spot
From the way she was blowin', I know she does it a lot
I have a eight-and-a-half, nine-and-three-quarters
The ho started callin' when I started boss ballin'
Gimme some head, gimme some ass (Uh-huh)
Gimme some cash, pass it to Daz
Pass it to Snoop, or pass it to Nate
See hoes eat dick like eggs and steak
It ain't shit new, I thought you knew (What?)
I knew you would, you wish you could
Break a G down, break me down
But I'ma see you on the rebound (What what?), 
D.P. style
[Chorus]
Now this, this is one of them occasions
Where the homies not doin' it right
I mean he found him a ho that he like
But you can't make a ho a housewife
And when it all boils down you gonna find in the end
A bitch is a bitch, but a Dogg is a man's best friend
So what? You found you a ho that you like
But you can't make a ho a housewife (Wife)[Outro]
Half-dead
Lil' Half-dead
 the one who jumped out to see ol' Snoop Dogg on lookout boys
He's going to be more than half dead if he don't fill my motherfucking drink up
I'll fill your motherfucking mouth up

[Intro]
We at war
We at war with terrorism, racism
But most of all, we at war with ourselves
[Chorus]
(Jesus, walk)
God, show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down
(Jesus, walk with me)
[Verse 1]
You know what the Midwest is? Young and restless
Where restless (Niggas) might snatch your necklace
And next, these (Niggas) might jack your Lexus
Somebody tell these (Niggas) who Kanye West is
I walk through the valley of the Chi where death is
Top floor, the view alone will leave you breathless *gasps*
Try to catch it *gasps* it's kinda hard
Getting choked by detectives, yeah, yeah, now check the method
They be askin' us questions, harass and arrest us
Sayin' ""We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast""
Huh? Y'all eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?
We ain't going nowhere but got suits and cases
A trunk full of coke, rental car from Avis
My mama used to say only Jesus can save us
Well, mama, I know I act a fool
But I'll be gone 'til November, I got packs to move, I hope[Chorus]
(Jesus, walk)
God, show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down
(Jesus, walk with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
(Jesus, walk)
And I don't think there's nothin' I can do now to right my wrongs
(Jesus, walk with me)
I wanna talk to God but I'm afraid 'cause we ain't spoke in so long
(Jesus, walk)
God, show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down
(Jesus, walk with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
(Jesus, walk)
And I don't think there's nothin' I can do now to right my wrongs
(Jesus, walk with me)
I wanna talk to God but I'm afraid 'cause we ain't spoke in so long
So long, so long
(Jesus, walk with me)
[Verse 2]
To the hustlers, killers, murderers, drug dealers, even the scrippers
(Jesus walks with them)
To the victims of welfare, feel we livin' in Hell here, hell yeah
(Jesus walks with them)
Now, hear ye, hear ye, want to see Thee more clearly
I know He hear me when my feet get weary
'Cause we're the almost nearly extinct
We rappers is role models, we rap, we don't think
I ain't here to argue about His facial features
Or here to convert atheists into believers
I'm just tryna say the way school need teachers
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis, that's the way I need Jesus
So here go my single, dawg, radio needs this
They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns, sex, lies, videotape
But if I talk about God, my record won't get played, huh?
Well, if this take away from my spins
Which'll probably take away from my ends
Then I hope it take away from my sins
And bring the day that I'm dreamin' 'bout
Next time I'm in the club, everybody screamin' out[Chorus]
(Jesus, walk)
God, show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down
(Jesus, walk with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
Hand me a towel, I'm dirty dancing by myself
Gone off tabs of that acid,
 
form me a circle, watch my Jagger
Might lose my jacket and hit a solo, one time
We too loud in public, them police turned down the function
Now we outside, and the timing's perfect
Forgot to tell you, gotta tell you how much I vibe with you
And we don't gotta be solo
Now stay away from highways
My eyes like them red lights
Right now, I prefer yellow
Redbone, so mellow
Fuck 'round, be cuttin' you
Think we were better off solo
I got that act right in the Windy City that night
No trees to blow through, but blow me and I owe you
Two grams when the sunrise
Smokin' good, rollin' solo

I'm skippin' showers and switchin' socks, sleepin' good and long
Bones feelin' dense as fuck, wish a nigga would cross
And catch a solo, on time
White leaf on my boxers, green leaf turn to vapors for the low
And that mean cheap, 'cause ain't shit free and I know it
Even love ain't, 'cause this nut cost, that clinic killed my soul
But you gotta hit the pussy raw though
Now your baby mama ain't so vicious
All she want is her picket fence
And you protest, and you picket sign
But them courts won't side with you
Won't let you fly solo, yeah
I wanted that act right in Colorado that night
I brought trees to blow through, but it's just me and no you
Stayed up 'til my phone died
Smokin' big, rollin' solo[Chorus: Frank Ocean]

[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now
[Verse 2]
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh
[Chorus]
'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well
[Verse 3]
Photo album on the counter, 
your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the 
tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, ""Any time now
He's gonna say it's love,"" you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to
[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah
[Bridge]
Well, maybe we got 
lost in translation
, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all[Verse 4]
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""
[Verse 5]
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah
[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well[Verse 6]
And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well
[Outro]
Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it (All too well)
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there

[Intro]
One, two, three, four
Ooh-ee-ooh, ah
Ooh-ee-ooh
[Verse 1]
So sweet
I give you kisses in the backseat
I whisper secrets in the backbeat
You make me cry, you make me happy, happy (Happy)
Leave my lipstick on the cigarette
Just toss it, and you stomp it out, out, out
Inhalin' whiskey when you kiss my neck
We've been hurtin', but it's happy hour, oh, hour
Oh, oh, oh
[Pre-Chorus]
They couldn't have me (Ah)
And they never will
And sometimes I hold you closer
Just to know you're real (Ah)
Wheels in the gravel
Davis in my bones
Sometimes I take the day off (Ah)
Just to turn you on
On, on, oh[Chorus]
Honеy, honey
I could be your bodyguard
 (Hey)
Oh, honеy, honey
I could be your Kevlar (Huh)
Oh, honey, honey
I could be your lifeguard (Huh)
Ooh, honey, honey
You should let me ride shotgun, shotgun
Oh, oh, oh
[Verse 2]
Be your best friend
I protect you in the mosh pit
And I'll defend you in the gossip
You know how people like to start shit and pop shit
I don't like the way she's lookin' at you
Someone better hold me back, oh-oh
Chargin' ten for a double and I'm talkin'
I'm 'bout to lose it, turn around and John Wayne that ass (
One, two, three, four
)
[Pre-Chorus]
They couldn't catch you (Ah, with me)
And they never will (You see)
Sometimes I hold you closer
Just to know you're real (Ah)
Tell me your problems (I got you)
I take how you feel (Mm, huh)
I show you an exit (Ah)
When you're restless, I take the wheel
Ooh, oh, oh[Chorus]
Honey, honey
You could be my bodyguard (Huh, uh)
Oh, honey, honey
Will you let me ride shotgun? Shotgun
Oh, oh, oh

I could be your bodyguard

Lucky Strike Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You're such a motivator, I gotta get you where
So sick of sayin', ""Yes sir, yes sir""
You're such an instigator, you wanna play the game
Take it or leave it, that's her, that's her
[Pre-Chorus]
And I can't wait another minute
I can't take the look she's giving
Your body rockin', keep me up all night
One in a million, my lucky strike
[Chorus]
Got me so high and then she dropped me
But she got me, she got me, she got me bad
Took me inside and then she rocked me
She keep me up all night, this is what it sounds like
(Whoa) My lucky strike
(Whoa) My lucky strike
(Whoa) Your body rocking, keep me up all night
(Oh) One in a million, my lucky strike
[Verse 2]
Stuck in her elevator, she take me to the sky
And I don't wanna go down, go down
She said, ""I'll feel you later, go ahead and fantasize""
She'll make me want her right now, right now[Pre-Chorus]
And I can't wait another minute
I can't take the look she's giving
Your body rocking, keep me up all night
One in a million, my lucky strike
[Chorus]
Got me so high and then she dropped me
But she got me, she got me, she got me bad
Took me inside and then she rocked me
She keep me up all night, this is what it sounds like
(Whoa) My lucky strike
(Whoa) My lucky strike
(Whoa) Your body rocking, keep me up all night
(Oh) One in a million, my lucky strike
[Bridge]
Hey, you're taking all my pain away
You're shaking like an earthquake
Hey, you're taking all my pain away
You're shaking like an earthquake
[Chorus]
Got me so high and then she dropped me
But she got me, she got me, she got me bad
Took me inside and then she rocked me
She keep me up all night, this is what it sounds like
(Whoa) My lucky strike
(Whoa) My lucky strike
(Whoa) Your body rocking, keep me up all night

[Verse 1: Gary Lightbody]
Find myself at your door
Just like all those times before
I’m not sure how I got there
All roads, they lead me here
I imagine you are home
In your room, all alone
And you open your eyes into mine
And everything feels better
[Pre-Chorus: Both]
And right before your eyes
I'm breaking, no past
No reasons why
Just you and me

This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye (Eye, eye)

You find yourself at my door
And just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave
And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better[Pre-Chorus: Both]
And right before your eyes
I'm aching, run fast
Nowhere to hide
Just you and me

[Verse 1]
Is it romantic how all my elegies eulogize me?
I'm not cut out for all these cynical clones
These hunters with cell phones
[Chorus]
Take me to the Lakes, where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse

What should be over, burrowed under my skin
In heart-stopping waves of hurt
I've come too far to watch some namedropping sleaze
Tell me what are my words worth

Take me to the Lakes, where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse
[Bridge]
I want auroras and sad prose
I want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet
'Cause I haven't moved in years
And I want you right here
A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground
With no one around to tweet it
While I bathe in cliffside pools
With my calamitous love and insurmountable grief[Chorus]
Take me to the Lakes, where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse

Premiered at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards, the song has been praised for its dark, theatrical style and energetic production. Critics highlighted its intense, catchy chorus, Europop-inspired climax, and Gaga's powerful vocal performance. It achieved 4.92 million Spotify streams on its first day, marking her biggest solo debut on the platform.

The music video, co-directed by Gaga, Parris Goebel, and Bethany Vargas, features a dramatic dance battle between two versions of Gaga—one in red latex, representing control, and the other in white, symbolizing chaos. The choreography reflects themes of duality, resilience, and the struggle between light and darkness. Critics compared its aesthetics to ""Bad Romance"" and praised its high-fashion visuals and dynamic energy. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Lady+Gaga/_/Abracadabra"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

[Verse 1]
Darlin', darlin' doesn't have a problem
Lyin' to herself 'cause her liquor's top shelf
It's alarming, honestly, how charming she can be
Fooling everyone, telling 'em she's having fun
[Pre-Chorus]
She says, ""You don't wanna be like me
Don't wanna see all the things I've seen
I'm dyin', I'm dyin'""
She says, ""You don't wanna get this way
Famous and dumb at an early age
Lyin', I'm lyin""
[Chorus]
The boys, the girls, they all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God, her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies, she's still shinin'
Like lightning, oh-oh
Like lightning
[Verse 2]
Carmen, Carmen, stayin' up 'til morning
Only seventeen, but she walks the streets so mean
It's alarming, truly, how disarmin' you can be
Eatin' soft ice cream, Coney Island queen[Pre-Chorus]
She says, ""You don't wanna be like me
Lookin' for fun, gettin' high for free
I'm dyin', I'm dyin'""
She says, ""You don't wanna get this way
Street walk at night and a star by day
It's tirin', tirin'""
[Chorus]
The boys, the girls, they all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God, her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies, she's still shinin'
Like lightning, oh-oh
Like lightning
[Bridge]
Baby's all dressed up with nowhere to go
That's the little story of the girl you know
Relyin' on the kindness of strangers
Tyin' cherry knots, smilin', doin' party favors
Put your red dress on, put your lipstick on
Sing your song, song, now the camera's on
And you're alive again
[Interlude]
Mon amour, je sais que tu m'aimes aussi
Tu as besoin de moi, tu as besoin de moi dans ta vie
Tu ne peux vivre sans moi
Et je mourrais sans toi
Je tuerais pour toi[Chorus]
The boys, the girls, they all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God, her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies, she's still shinin'

The song tells the story of a young woman named Carmen, who despite her captivating allure, is struggling with addiction, loneliness, and eventually meets her demise. The lyrics describe her as charming, disarming, and a confidant of sorts, but also as a liar who is deceiving everyone around her about her struggles.

The song tells the story of a young woman named Carmen, who despite her captivating allure, is struggling with addiction, loneliness, and eventually meets her demise. The lyrics describe her as charming, disarming, and a confidant of sorts, but also as a liar who is deceiving everyone around her about her struggles.

In the first verse, Carmen is depicted as someone who has access to top-shelf liquor, which may be an indication of her dangerous indulgences. The pre-chorus and chorus describe her as being popular amongst boys and girls alike, with her charismatic and seductive persona, but she warns them not to be like her. She acknowledges her own addiction and the toll it's taking on her life.

The second verse portrays Carmen as a young girl who is already walking the streets at night, portraying a dangerous and risky lifestyle. The lyrics hint at the fact that Carmen is using drugs to cope with her struggles, leaving her disarming and alarming to those around her who care for her well-being.

The bridge suggests that Carmen is relying on the kindness of strangers and is engaging in risky behavior such as using drugs and participating in party favors. The interlude adds a layer of tragic love to the story, with Carmen's lover confessing to being unable to live without her, and Carmen willing to do anything for him.

The song's haunting outro returns to the lyrical theme of Carmen's addiction - that she has a problem but continues to drink from her top-shelf liquor. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Lana+Del+Rey/_/Carmen"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

[Intro]
Psst, I see dead people
(
Mustard on the beat, ho
)
[Verse 1]
Ayy, Mustard on the beat, ho
Deebo any rap nigga, he a free throw
Man down, call an amberlamps, tell him, ""Breathe, bro""
Nail a nigga to the cross, he walk around like Teezo
What's up with these jabroni-ass niggas tryna see Compton?
The industry can hate me, fuck 'em all and they mama
How many opps you really got? I mean, it's too many options
I'm finna pass on this body, I'm John Stockton
Beat your ass and hide the Bible if God watchin'
Sometimes you gotta pop out and show niggas
Certified boogeyman, I'm the one that up the score with 'em
Walk him down, whole time, I know he got some ho in him
Pole on him, extort shit, bully Death Row on him
Say, Drake, I hear you like 'em young
You better not ever go to cell block one
To any bitch that talk to him and they in love
Just make sure you hide your lil' sister from him
They tell me Chubbs the only one that get your hand-me-downs
And Party at the party playin' with his nose now
And Baka got a weird case, why is he around?
Certified Lover Boy? Certified pedophiles
Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, Dot, fuck 'em up
Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, I'ma do my stuff
Why you trollin' like a bitch? Ain't you tired?
Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A minor[Chorus]
They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
[Verse 2]
You think the Bay gon' let you disrespect Pac, nigga?
I think that Oakland show gon' be your last stop, nigga
Did Cole foul, I don't know why you still pretendin'
What is the owl? Bird niggas and burnt bitches, go
The audience not dumb
Shape the stories how you want, hey, Drake, they're not slow
Rabbit hole is still deep, I can go further, I promise
Ain't that somethin'? B-Rad stands for bitch and you Malibu most wanted
Ain't no law, boy, you ball boy, fetch Gatorade or somethin'
Since 2009, I had this bitch jumpin'
You niggas'll get a wedgie, be flipped over your boxers
What OVO for? The ""Other Vaginal Option""? Pussy
Nigga better straighten they posture, got famous all up in Compton
Might write this for the doctorate,
 
tell the pop star quit hidin'
Fuck a caption, want action, no accident
And I'm hands-on, he fuck around, get polished
Fucked on Wayne girl while he was in jail, that's connivin'
Then get his face tatted like a bitch apologizin'
I'm glad DeRoz' came home, y'all didn't deserve him neither
From Alondra down to Central, nigga better not speak on Serena
And your homeboy need subpoena, that predator move in flocks
That name gotta be registered and placed on neighborhood watch
I lean on you niggas like another line of Wock'
Yeah, it's all eyes on me, and I'ma send it up to Pac, ayy
Put the wrong label on me, I'ma get 'em dropped, ayy
Sweet Chin Music and I won't pass the aux, ayy
How many stocks do I really have in stock? Ayy
One, two, three, four, five, plus five, ayy
Devil is a lie,
 
he a 69 God, ayy
Freaky-ass niggas need to stay they ass inside, ayy
Roll they ass up like a fresh pack of 'za, ayy
City is back up, it's a must, we outside, ayy[Chorus]
They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
[Verse 3]
Once upon a time, all of us was in chains
Homie still doubled down callin' us some slaves
Atlanta was the Mecca, buildin' railroads and trains
Bear with me for a second, let me put y'all on game
The settlers was usin' townfolk to make 'em richer
Fast-forward, 2024, you got the same agenda
You run to Atlanta when you need a check balance
Let me break it down for you, this the real nigga challenge
You called Future when you didn't see the club (Ayy, what?)
Lil Baby helped you get your lingo up (What?)
21 gave you false street cred
Thug made you feel like you a slime in your head (Ayy, what?)
Quavo said you can be from Northside (What?)
2 Chainz say you good, but he lied
You run to Atlanta when you need a few dollars
No, you not a colleague, you a fuckin' colonizer
The family matter and the truth of the matter
It was God's plan to show y'all the liar
[Bridge]
Mm
Mm-mm
He a fan, he a fan, he a fan (Mm)
He a fan, he a fan, he a
Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God
Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God
Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God
Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God
Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
Let me hear you say, ""OV-ho"" (

Português
Русский
Slow Jamz Lyrics
“Slow Jamz” is a smooth, melodic track from Kanye West’s debut album. Jamie Foxx’s hook and Twista’s fast-paced verse are some of the more memorable parts of the album.
[Intro: Jamie Foxx]
Kanye, it's, it's Foxx, man
I'm just sayin', you know, I was talkin' to the girls, you know
And we, we don't put enough emphasis on the ladies sometime
You know, I was talkin' to this girl
She was talkin' about the music all fast in the club, you know
She gotta drink water 'cause she thirsty
She done danced like ninety to a hundred songs back to back
When ain't nobody, you know, really try to find out what she feelin'
Like how she feel, you know, you know what she told me?
(Are you gonna be?) Check it out, this is what she said
(Say that you're gonna be) Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oooh
[Chorus: Jamie Foxx & 
Luther
]
She said she want some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross
A little Anita will definitely set this party off right
(
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, well, well, well, well
)
She said she want some Ready for the World, some New Edition
Some Minnie Riperton will definitely set this party off right
(
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, well, well, well, well
)
[Interlude: Kanye West]
Yes, it will
It definitely will!
You know what I told her?[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I told her to drive over in yo' new whip, bring some friends you cool with
I'ma bring the cool whip, then I want you to strip
See, you is my new chick, so we get our grind on
She be grabbin', callin' me Biggie like Shyne home
Man, I swear, she fine homes, why she always lyin', though?
Tellin' me them diamonds, when she know they rhinestones
She got a light-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
Got a dark-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
I played 
Ready for the World
, she was ready for some action
My dog said you ain't no freak so you 'bout to prove my man wrong
I'ma play this Vandross, you gon' take yo' pants off
I'ma play this Gladys Knight, me and you gon' get right
[Chorus: Jamie Foxx & 
Luther
]
She said she want some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross
A little Anita will definitely set this party off right

She said she want some Ready for the World, some New Edition
Some Minnie Riperton will definitely set this party off right

Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, well well well well

[Bridge: Jamie Foxx]
Smokey Robinson, Smokey Robinson
Freddie Jackson, everything, everything (Well, well, well, well)
Smokey Robinson, Ashford & Simpson (Are you gonna be)
Set the party, really set the party off right
Yes, it will, yes, it will (Well, well, well, well)
Al Green, oh! Al Green, oh yeah
Oooh
Whatcha know about the Isley Brothers?[Interlude: Aisha Tyler & 
Kanye West
]
Now, Kanye, I know I told you to slow it down, baby
It's good, it's all good, it's beautiful
But now I need you to do it faster, baby
Can you please? Do it faster, baby, do it faster!
Damn, baby, I can't do it that fast
But I know somebody who can, Twista!
[Verse 2: Twista]
Got you looking at the glist on my hands and wrist
While I'm layin' back and smoking on my cannabis
When it come to rockin' the rhythm like Marvin and Luther
I can tell you ain't no messin' with Kan Man and Twist
In the Chi and I be sippin' Hennessy, play some R&B
While I smoke a b, you can preferably find that I'm a G
And all is (Well, well, well, well)
Come wit' me and sip on some Evelyn Champagne
You ain't know Twista could work it like the Whispers?
Hit the stop light, 
move it to some Isleys
Rims still movin' so I bump a lil' Spinners
While I'm smoking on a b, dippin' through the streets
Bumpin' R&B and I got the heat on the 23's
And I do it (Well, well, well, well)
Wit' my Earth in the Wind smoking Fire
Let me get ya sheets wet listenin' to Keith Sweat
Put you in a daze wit' Maze
Fulfilling our every temptation
Slow jammin', havin' deep sex
You ready for the world, girl, come on, go wit' me
I touch you all over your body, baby, don't say no to me
And every moment be controlling me
I'm lovin' the way you be holdin' me when I be listenin' to Jodeci
And when I come over and bend ya ass
You be bumpin' Teddy Pendergrass
I done hit it from the back, to the melody and rode it slow
Now I got to go up in it fast, but I'ma finish last
No matter how much of a thug you see
I still spit it like it's R&B, come to the club wit' me
And when some Luther come on, I hope you feelin' me
And still will be in love wit' me, Chi ride[Chorus: Jamie Foxx & 
Luther
]
She said she want some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross
A little Anita will definitely set this party off right

Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, well, well, well, well
)
She said she want some Ready for the World, some New Edition
Some Minnie Riperton will definitely set this party off right
(
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, well, well, well, well

Let's get the party on (Let's get the party on)

[Verse 1]
Long handwritten note deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait
[Chorus]
We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair
[Verse 2]
In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation
We both wake in lonely beds, different cities
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons, and darling, they all look like me
[Chorus]
'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair
[Bridge]
Distance, timing
Breakdown, fighting
Silence, the train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it
Could you just try to listen?
Hang up, give up
And for the life of us we can't get back[Breakdown]
A beautiful, magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic
Beautiful, tragic, beautiful

Metaphor : People live very fast and overloading, better live in the moment, live slowly, looking at the present and not the goals that make you unhappy.

Cyrus first teased the new era with cryptic posters around the world that featured lyrics and a release date. Fans were skeptical about it, until she later dropped the first teaser on New Year’s Eve, along with announcing the single’s title and release date. Minutes later, a second teaser was released. A music video for the single was accompanied with the single’s release.

The song heavily interpolates and draws upon the themes of Bruno Mars' 2012 song  When I Was Your Man, and can be seen in some regards as a spiritual successor and a ""response"" to Mars' song from the perspective of the other party in a failed relationship. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Miley+Cyrus/_/Flowers"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

""Lost in Japan"" is a funk, pop and R&B song, with ""funky strings and driving bass"" that bears resemblances to the work of Justin Timberlake. During interviews, Mendes stated that he was inspired by all of the Timberlake songs he was listening to at the time, especially Justified–and a dream. ""I had this dream that I was lost in this country and I woke up the next day and we had this cool piano part and the song was birthed.""

Lars Brandle of Billboard wrote that the song ""opens with a subtle spell of piano then changes gears with a fat bass sound and groove"". It transformed from ""a slow, piano-driven number"" into ""a passionate, hook-laden love song"", according to CBS Radio's Robyn Collins. Lyrically, Mendes offers to travel the globe in order to be closer to his love interest. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Shawn+Mendes/_/Lost+In+Japan"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

GRAVITY Lyrics
[Verse 1: Yonghoon]
I'm a gravity
I feel like I'm floating on cloud nine
You're my gravity
Leanin' one side, tangled and intertwined
I can't ignore
To call it love
Something meant to be
We just can't deny it anymore
[Pre-Chorus: Dongmyeong]
The barren land, empty roads, end up to find, aim you're mine
Fallin' down, my love, oh
Can't resist you, I got you in my mind, in your time
Losing myself to love
[Chorus: Yonghoon]
I'm a gravity
Pulling towards us, you and I
I wanna be, wanna be, wanna be with you
Fallin' to you, fallin' to you
Gravity
Even if it's dangerous to die
I wanna be, wanna be, wanna be with you
Fallin' to you, fallin' to you, fallin' to you[Verse 2: CyA]
Yeah, yeah
I'm a gravity
My eyes are revolution, deep in your personality, ayy
In any hypothesis
My love doesn't change, break the frame of tragedy
My heart gets possessive
'Cause I feel that I'm cooped up
My love is the only gravity
Like the new avengers ability
[Pre-Chorus: Yonghoon, 
Dongmyeong
]
My feelings change every moment in my mind
It hovers behind, spreadin' the flowers, woah
You cover me gently and we become bind, we're combined
Losing my mind to love
[Chorus: Yonghoon]
I'm a gravity
Pulling towards us, you and I
I wanna be, wanna be, wanna be with you
Fallin' to you, fallin' to you
Gravity
Even if it's dangerous to die
I wanna be, wanna be, wanna be with you
Fallin' to you, fallin' to you, fallin' to you[Bridge: Dongmyeong, 
Yonghoon
]
Without you, there's no life
I call you the one
That I want you
That I want you
There's no reason to live without you
'Cause I'm nothing without you
I can't do, I can't do anything
Remember you're me and I'm you
[Chorus: Yonghoon]
I'm a gravity
Pulling towards us, you and I
I wanna be, wanna be, wanna be with you
Fallin' to you, fallin' to you
Gravity
Even if it's dangerous to die
I wanna be, wanna be, wanna be with you
Fallin' to you, fallin' to you, fallin' to you

Ultimately, the narrator comes to the realization that she is in control of her own fate in this regard – she's able to remove the ""veil from off her eyes"" to see the bigger picture and can choose to stay away from people and activities that will drag her down.

And I'm not trying to come off too strong
But you know that I can't help It

The space in between us starts to feel like we're worlds apart
Like I'm going crazy, and you say it's raining in your heart
You're telling me nobody's there to dry up the flood
Oh, but that's just crazy
'Cause baby, I told you I'm here for good

It won't be long, just know that you're not alone

I try to build the walls to keep you safe when I'm not around
But as soon as I'm away from you, you say they come tumbling down
But it's not about the time that we don't get to spend together

When I'm gone and it feels like forever

[Verse 1]
Let it fade to black
Let me run my fingers down your back
Let's whisper, let's don't talk
Baby, leave my t-shirt in the hall
Like a needle finds a groove
Baby, we'll remember what to do
To drown out every distraction
It's time we made it happen
[Chorus]
Strip it down, strip it down
Back to you and me like it used to be
When it was an old back road with an old school beat
Cowboy boots by your little bare feet
Let it out, tell me right now
Everything I need in them white cotton sheets
Dirty dance me slow in the summertime heat
Feel my belt turn loose from these old blue jeans
We both know that we lost it somehow
Let's get it found
Strip it down, down, down
[Verse 2]
I wanna drop this cell phone now
And let it shatter on the ground
They ain’t holdin’ nothin’, these two hands
Until they’re holding you again[Chorus]
Oh, strip it down, strip it down
Back to you and me like it used to be
When it was an old back road with an old school beat
Cowboy boots by your little bare feet
Let it out, tell me right now
Everything I need in them white cotton sheets
Dirty dance me slow in the summertime heat
Feel my belt turn loose from these old blue jeans
We both know that we lost it somehow
Let’s get it found
Strip it down, down, down
Strip it down, down, down

I don’t wanna let you go
No, not tonight
I just wanna love you so bad, baby
So let's close our eyes

And strip it down, strip it down

Additionally, the soothing boom-bap production is unusual for Travis, who is well-known for his genre-bending contributions to trap music.

It should also be noted that there is a popular coffee chain in Los Angeles (Travis and Kylie’s home) called The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, which is typically shortened to “Coffee Bean.”

Throughout the song, Travis alternates between being on and off the coffee bean, which represents the internal struggle that Travis feels in regards to his relationship with now ex-girlfriend Kylie Jenner. The term “bean” is also commonly used to refer to Ecstacy, although it is unclear if that is what Travis is referring to.

Vanish Into You Lyrics
[Intro]
Saw your face and mine
In a picture by our bedside
It was cold in the summertime
[Verse 1]
High on a hill, you call
Two lovers regret their time
Once in a blue moon, I forget you
And once in your life, you'll be mine
[Pre-Chorus]
Do you see me? Do you see me now?
I've been waiting for you, cryin' out
Do you see me? Do you see me now?
[Chorus]
Saw your face and mine
In a picture by our bedside
It was cold in the summertime
We were happy just to be alive
Can I vanish into you?
Can I vanish into you? (Yah)
[Verse 2]
Into the night, we fly
Sirens blow by our heads (Yah)[Pre-Chorus]
Do you see me? Do you see me now?
I've been waiting for you, cryin' out
Do you see me? Do you see me now?
[Chorus]
Saw your face and mine
In a picture by our bedside
It was cold in the summertime
We were happy just to be alive
Can I vanish into you?
Can I vanish into you?
[Instrumental Break]
(Yah)
[Chorus]
Saw your face and mine
In a picture by, by, by, by my bedside
It was cold in the summertime
We were happy just to be alive
Can I, I vanish into you?
Can I vanish into you? (Can I? Can I?)
Like a ghost, I, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, vanish into you
Can I vanish into you?[Outro]
When I die, can I vanish into you

To the 
Houses of the Holy
, smokin' on them cigarettes
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
He was cool as heck
He was cool as heck

And we were so obsessed with writing the next best American record

We were so obsessed with writing the next best American record

My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
He was '70s in spirit‚ '90s in his frame of mind

We lost track of time[Pre-Chorus]

Malibu
 and I want it

It's you‚ all the roads lead to you
Everything I want and do, all the things that I say
It's true, all the roads lead to you
Like the 405 I drive through
Every night and every day
I see you for who you really are
Why the thousands of girls love
The way Bill plays guitar

It suggests a carefree and fun-loving dynamic, while also emphasizing the importance of personal connections and relationships.

The song reflects on a past romance where the two individuals involved were so consumed by their desire to create ""the next best American record"" that it became all they thought and talked about. The lyrics suggest a carefree and exciting relationship where the two were just happy to be with each other, lost in their creativity and love.

The lines ""My baby used to dance underneath my architecture"" and ""He was '70s in spirit, '90s in his frame of mind"" suggest a certain nostalgia for the past and the idea that the two were inspired by the music and culture of earlier decades. There is also a sense of longing and reminiscence in the repeated line ""My baby used to dance underneath my architecture"".

The chorus discusses the desire to let loose and have fun, with the speaker expressing their desire to simply party and enjoy themselves, particularly in the line ""Topanga's hot tonight, I'm taking off my bathing suit"". However, this desire to let loose is tied to the presence of the other person: ""You make me feel like there's something that I never knew I wanted"".

The bridge of the song further emphasizes the importance of the other person, with the repeated lines ""all the roads lead to you"" and ""I see you for who you really are"". The mention of Bill playing guitar suggests a specific individual, perhaps someone she admires or is inspired by.

During the ""Kid A"" sessions in 1999, Radiohead recorded demos for the song in various studios, until it was recorded at their Oxfordshire studio at the end of January, 2000. In early February, the strings were recorded and performed by the Orchestra of St John's inside a church near the band's studio, composed by the multi-instrumentalist Jonny Greenwood on an ondes Martenot. An isolated strings track was included on the compilation ""Kid Amnesia"".

“That song is about the whole period of time that ""OK Computer"" was happening. We did the Glastonbury Festival and this thing in Ireland. Something snapped in me. I just said, ‘That’s it. I can’t take it anymore.’ And more than a year later, we were still on the road. I hadn’t had time to address things. The lyrics came from something Michael Stipe said to me. I rang him and said, ‘I cannot cope with this.’ And he said, ‘Pull the shutters down and keep saying, 'I’m not here, this is not happening.’” — Thom Yorke <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/_/How+to+Disappear+Completely"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Love's gonna get you killed
But pride’s gonna be the death of you and you and me
And you and you and you and me
And you and you and you and me
And you and you and you and me and—
[Chorus: Steve Lacy &

Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
In another life, I surely was there
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
I care, 
I care
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Hell-raising, wheel-chasing, new worldly possessions
Flesh-making, spirit-breaking, which one would you lessen?
The better part, the human heart, you love ’em or dissect 'em
Happiness or flashiness? How do you serve the question?
See, in a perfect world, I would be perfect, world
I don't trust people enough beyond they surface, world
I don't love people enough to put my faith in man
I put my faith in these lyrics,
 
hoping I make a band
I understand I ain't perfect, I probably won't come around
This time I might put you down
Last time I ain't give a fuck, I still feel the same now
My feelings might go numb, you're dealin’ with cold thumb
I’m willin' to give up a leg and arm to show empathy from
Pity parties and functions of you and yours
A perfect world, you probably live another 24
I can’t fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure
I can't fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure[Chorus: Steve Lacy &

Maybe I wasn't there (We saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Now, in a perfect world, I probably won't be insensitive
Cold as December but never remember what winter did
I wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid
Seems like I point the finger just to make a point nowadays
Smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there
Indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here
I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back
The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that
Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies
Promises are broken and more resentment come alive
Race barriers make inferior of you and I
See, in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches
I'll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison
I'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service
Just to tell 'em we ain't shit, but He's been perfect, world[Chorus: Steve Lacy &

But I'll be back again

Than to break my heart again

That if I ran away from you
That you would want me, too
But I got a big surprise

[Verse 1]
You turn on the light, then you turn it back off
'Cause sleepin' alone, yeah, it ain't what you thought
It's the drip of the sink, it's the click of the clock
And you're wonderin' if I'm sleepin'
You heard from your friends that I'm doin' okay
And you're thinkin' that maybe you made a mistake
And you want me to know, but I don't wanna know how you're feeling

Keep it to yourself (
Oh

If you think that you still love me
Put it on a shelf (

Make it someone else
When you're drunk, and it's late
And you're missin' me like hell
Keep it to yourself

If you see me out and I'm standing alone
Well, it don't mean that I'm gonna need a ride home
If you walk up to me like it ain't what it is
I know that it ain't gonna end with a kiss

In the empowering feminist anthem, Lipa can be heard singing about how confident she feels while proudly referring to herself as a strong and optimistic ""female alpha.""

Hours before its official US release, Dua took to social media to announce the song. Compared to other tracks, “Future Nostalgia” has a more experimental sound. The artist herself described it as “playful and fun and not […] too serious.”

That you and I, we'd go down in history together, yeah

Street lights along the highway
Throwin' shadows in the dark
And the memories keep on turnin'
To the rhythm of a broken heart
[Chorus]
You only need a roof when it's rainin'
You only need a fire when it's cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing that you have left to hold
Sun comes up and goes back down
And fallin' feels like flyin' 'til you hit the ground
Say the word and I'll be there for you
Baby, I will be your parachute

There's a song that I remember
I never learned to play
And a lifetime of forgotten words

You only need a drink when the whiskey

Say the word and I’ll be there for you
Baby, I will be your parachute

If you think you're goin' down
Just know I will be around

She constructs this sense through extended metaphors and semantics of togetherness, like when she states the situation is akin ‘like the moon needs the stars’ – the celestial nature suggested here may also be an allusion towards sexual intercourse, likening an orgasm to a supernatural experience.

Ariana is also heavily superstitious, believing in the ‘supernatural’, therefore, it is fitting how Ariana suggests that it is some exterior power pulling them together, not fighting it as it’s part of the being's will. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Ariana+Grande/_/supernatural"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Murder Ink Lyrics
The track title is a reference to the phrase later more popular in Hip Hop, to “murder ink (write some dope shit)”. It’s a potential double-entendre as it’s also the concept that Roq, Hitt, and Dre make up a…

[Verse 1: Hittman]
When darkness be closin' in
I motivate, with the howlin' wind
, 
With a list of chosen men
Frozen in sin
, knowin' that your end is beginnin'
Swift silent and deadly
There's no defending my plots
I know your every movement – 
for six months I watch
Could've got you at your baby's mother's house, even at your down-low weed spot
But the backdrop, wasn't flattering enough
I didn't want people gathering and stuff
Snapshots of blood splattering from the snuff
Here – puff this cig, while I figure which way to split your wig
Right now you as nervous, as a Farmer John pig
As I dig into my tragic bag, take out the HK
Twist on the silencer, insert the 30 shot mag
Bullet stuck to his brain like a magnet
Skull in fragments, I leave the cleanup to 
Dragnet
[Chorus: Hittman]
This is anybody (
Murderer
)
To fuckin' everybody (Murderer)
Nigga, all y'all (Murderer)
Uh, uh, for real, you'll fuck around and get killed
This is anybody (Murderer)
Motherfuckin' everybody (Murderer)
Yeah nigga, all y'all (Murderer)
Uh, uh, for real, you'll fuck around and get killed[Verse 2: Ms. Roq]
Peeped all the stash drop and exchange of the dough
Lurkin' through the turf, thinkin' how much it's worth
Give 'em chase to the crib and yo, he properly laced
Stepped out the car, put my steel to the side of his face
Murder is the fuckin' Case, rob this nigga and shake
The fuckin' spot, 'cause in a few it's gon' be crawlin with cops!
Who's the bad bitch now? You crept on, paid the piper
Who'd've thought a sexy bitch could be a murderous sniper
Detrimental to your health, should've learned your lesson
But it's too late nigga bye-bye, better count your blessings
I been watchin' you watchin' me, yeah you ballin'
Was, nigga now you finger fucked and steady fallin'
A thug wit no love, but bitch niggas die fast
Thug niggas die young – oh, what? You thought you would last?
Blast two shots to the dome, slide back to the pad
And jack my nigga off 'til his dick get soft
Resume the wifey boo shit, 'cause yo, my man don't know
That his bitch is straight ill, serving ass with po'-po'
[Chorus: Ms. Roq]
I'm a motherfuckin' (Murderer)
Bitch, this is anybody (Murderer)
Yeah, nigga, all y'all (Murderer)
Uh, uh, for real, you'll fuck around and get killed

Doves in the Wind Lyrics
In a song “dedicated to vaginas,” SZA enlists fellow TDE mate Kendrick Lamar to talk about how there is so much more to offer than sex and things people do to go out of their way to get pussy.

[Verse 1: SZA]
Real niggas do not deserve pussy
Meaning it's more you see right through walls
Ain't talkin' about pussy
Meaning you deserve the whole box of chocolates
Come with me
Forrest Gump had a lot goin' for him
Never without pussy
You know, Jenny almost gave it all up for him
Never even pushed for the pussy
Where's Forrest now when you need him?
Talk to me, talk to me, hey, ayy, hey
[Chorus: SZA]
Attention, all you niggas, all you bitches
Sit back and relax your mind, just ride, just ride
Sit back and relax, you'll find just why, just why (Why)
Sit back, relax, just ease your mind, just ride (Ride, ride, ride)
You are now watching MADtv
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Niggas'll lose they mind for it, wine for it, dine for it (Pussy)
Spend time for it, see no colored line for it (Pussy)
Double back, handicap, and go blind for it (Pussy)
Pussy got endless prisoners, pussy always revengin' her
Pussy is calculatin' and good pussy is rather dangerous
Pussy can be so facetious, the heavyweight champ
Pussy is so undefeated, let's amen to that
I mean, the pump fakes on the Facebooks
And the screw face when the bae look
Won't get you no pussy
I mean, the fake chains and the code names
For insecure, gon' reassure you not to get pussy (You not to get)
You overcompensate too much for the pussy
You like to throw all kinda shade for the pussy
See, that's what pussy niggas do
I know the ways of a pussy, I see pussy lookin' at you
How many niggas get mistaken for clitoris in a day?
How many sentiments you make before runnin' pussy away?
How many times she gotta tell you that dick is disposable?
But if she fuck a young nigga like me, it's over for you
Solána, middle fingers up, speak your truth[Verse 3: SZA]
You could never trivialize pussy
But a bum nigga like you would try it (Pussy)
I know what you really 'bout
High-key, your **** is weak buddy (Pussy)
It's only replaced by a rubber substitute
We ain't feelin' you, oh
I think I caught a vibe, kinda feel a nigga
You could touch the booty if you like, I ain't trippin' on ya
(
Such a nice girl, SZA
)
I'm really tryna crack off on the headboard
And bust it wide open for the right one
Is you that for me?
'Cause if you that for me
[Bridge]
Like doves in the wind, hey, hey
Pussy like doves in the wind, hey, hey
Pussy like doves in the wind
[Chorus]
I will make you beg for it 
(
Attention, all you niggas
)
I wanna see you crawl 
(
All you bitches
)
I'll give you all of me and I won't stop, not a little bit
(Sit back and relax your mind, just ride, just ride)
Make you beg for it, I wanted to do it all
(Sit back and relax, you'll find just why, just why)
Unfortunately, you couldn't get your shit together
(Sit back, relax, just ease your mind, just ride)
(Ride, ride, ride)
You are now watching MADtv[Outro: Mommy]
We take things, and my influence so far, and then it's out of my hands. And, you know, while as I said it can be scary, it can also be a little bit comforting. Because I've learned that when I get to that point, and I can acknowledge,

Mark My Words Lyrics
Justin confirmed on one of his appearances on The Ellen Degeneres Show that this song — along with “Sorry” and “What Do You Mean?” — is about former flame, Selena Gomez.
[Chorus]
Mark my words, that's all that I have
Mark my words, give you all I got
In every way I will
You're the only reason why
Oh, I don't wanna live a lie
Mark my words
Mark my words
[Verse]
So you heard it all before
Falling in and out of trust
Trying to rekindle us
Only to lose yourself
But I won't let me lose you
And I won't let us just fade away
After all that we've been through
I'ma show you more than I ever could say

Anything For Love Lyrics
[Intro]
One more time
Go one more time, make you cry again
I'm just sitting—, I'm sitting in the middle of all of you
Argh, this is so intense
While Danny eats salted liquorice, that's nice
Okay, all right, let's do it, let's put it down
[Chorus]
And I'm not interested in a love that gives up so easily
I want a love that's set on keeping me
When it hurts, we don't even think to cut it off
And I'm not interested in a heart that doesn't beat for me
I want a mind that meets me equally
When it's hard, it won't evеr feel like it's too much
Remembеr when we used to do anything for love?
[Verse]
We're all so scared of forever
And no one promises always
We're not perfect together
That means we gotta part ways
Remember when
We used to do anything for love? Mmm-hmm
We're all terrified of heartbreak
Run at first signs of problems
Make it look way too easy
We all got too many options
Remember when (Remember when)
We used to do anything for love? (Anything for love)[Chorus]
But I'm not interested in a love that gives up so easily
I want a love that's set on keeping me
When it hurts, we don't even think to cut it off
Remember when (Remember when) we used to do anything for love?

It was released on May 3, 2024 through Warner Records.

“We made this whole record in a room in London in a studio in Kensal Rise. And that became my home for a year and a half and I have this big thing about studios because I love a place that has windows and light. A lot of studios don’t have that. That room has seen me through every season, has seen me through every emotion. I feel like my ideas can breathe in a room like that. And we were all together in the room, and engineer Jan, who’d been there for the whole year and a half with us helping us like set the mics up and do everything, he’s a super talented piano player. I asked him to play for us in that moment. I was like “Jan I think you should be a part of this track as well” and he came and played. It was just beautiful to have the energy of all the people who have played a little role in making this record with me. It was really just me on an SM7 kind of mic in the room making “Anything For Love”.

“Anything For Love” I guess is this idea that we live in such a fast world where it feels like things are easy to dispose of. So people don’t really fight for things that they really care about or they’re very quick to let go of things that are meaningful. And in that sense that’s where I went in for “Anything For Love”. It’s like remember the time when people really fought for something or love really meant something, and it wasn’t just this throwaway thing? So that’s really where that song stemmed from.“ — via Zach Sang Show <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Dua+Lipa/_/Anything+for+Love"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Sweetest Goodbye Lyrics
[Intro]
Oh, uh-huh
Yeah, yeah, oh
[Verse 1]
Where you are seems to be
As far as an eternity
Outstretched arms, open hearts
And if it never ends, then when do we start?
[Pre-Chorus]
I'll never leave you behind
Or treat you unkind
I know you understand
And with a tear in my eye
Give me the sweetest goodbye
That I ever did receive
[Chorus]
Pushing forward and arching back
Bring me closer to heart attack
Say goodbye and just fly away
When you come back
I have something to say, yeah
How does it feel to know you'll never have to be alone
When you get home? (Home)
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I...[Verse 2]
Dream away every day
Try so hard to disregard
The rhythm of the rain that drops
And coincides with the beating of my heart
[Pre-Chorus]
I'll never leave you behind
Or treat you unkind
And I know you'll understand, yeah, yeah, yeah
And with a tear in my eye
Give me the sweetest goodbye
That I ever, ever, ever did receive
[Chorus]
Pushing forward and arching back
Bring me closer to heart attack
Say goodbye and just fly away
When you come back
I have something to say, yeah
How does it feel to know you'll never have to be alone
When you get home? (Home)
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I feel, feel, feel, feel
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
Pushing forward and arching back (Yeah, oh)
Bring me closer to heart attack (Oh-oh-oh, yeah)[Outro]
How does it feel to know you'll never have to be alone
When you get home? (Home)
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I feel, feel, feel, feel

[Sample: Boris Gardiner]
Every nigga is a star, ayy, every nigga is a star
Every nigga is a star, ayy, every nigga is a star
Every nigga is a star, ayy
Who will deny that you and I and every nigga is a star?
[Intro: Josef Leimberg]
Hit me!
When the four corners of this cocoon collide
You'll slip through the cracks hopin' that you'll survive
Gather your wit, take a deep look inside
Are you really who they idolize?
To Pimp a Butterfly
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
At first, I did love you
But now I just wanna fuck
Late nights thinkin' of you
Until I get my nut
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board
Destroyed, but what for?[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
When I get signed, homie, I'ma act a fool
Hit the dance floor, strobe lights in the room
Snatch your little secretary bitch for the homies
Blue-eyed devil with a fat-ass monkey
I'ma buy a brand new Caddy on vogues
Trunk the hood up, two times, deuce-four
Platinum on everythin', platinum on weddin' ring
Married to the game and a bad bitch chose
When I get signed, homie, I'ma buy a strap
Straight from the CIA, set it on my lap
Take a few M-16s to the hood
Pass 'em all out on the block, what's good?
I'ma put the Compton swap meet by the White House
Republican run up, get socked out
Hit the press with a Cuban link on my neck
Uneducated, but I got a million-dollar check like that
[Refrain: Thundercat & George Clinton]
We should never gave
We should never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home
We should never gave
We should never gave niggas money

Bridges burned, all across the board (
Across the board

Destroyed, but what for?
[Break: Dr. Dre]
Yo, what's up? It's Dre
Remember the first time you came out to the house?
You said you wanted a spot like mine
But remember, anybody can get it
The hard part is keepin' it, motherfucker
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
What you want you? A house or a car?
Forty acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
Anythin', see, my name is Uncle Sam, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I know your kind (That's why I'm kind)
Don't have receipts (Oh, man, that's fine)
Pay me later, wear those gators
Cliché? Then say, ""Fuck your haters""
I can see the baller in you, I can see the dollar in you
Little white lies, but it's no white-collar in you
But it's whatever though because I'm still followin' you
Because you make me live forever, baby
Count it all together, baby
Then hit the register and make me feel better, baby
Your horoscope is a Gemini, two sides
So you better cop everything two times
Two coupes, two chains, two C-notes
Too much ain't enough, both we know
Christmas, tell 'em what's on your wish list
Get it all, you deserve it, Kendrick
And when you hit the White House, do you
But remember, you ain't pass economics in school
And everything you buy, taxes will deny
I'll Wesley Snipe your ass before thirty-five (Yeah)[Bridge: George Clinton & 
Kendrick Lamar
]
Yeah, lookin' down, it's quite a drop 
(It's quite a drop, drop, drop
)
Lookin' good when you're on top 
(We’re on top together)
You got a medal for us
Leavin' metaphors
 metaphysically in a state of euphoria
Look both ways before you cross my mind
[Refrain: Thundercat & George Clinton]
We should never gave
We should never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home
We should never gave
We should never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home

The first verse pictures a young Kendrick deluded by money, whilst the second is the perspective of “Uncle Sam” – a personification of the U.S Government and White America – trying to charm him.

In other words, Wesley's Theory illustrates how America (represented by Uncle Sam) exploits financially illiterate rappers with newfound success (such as Kendrick after GKMC) by enticing them to purchase copious expensive items without realising they have to pay taxes for those items. First verse is Kendrick wanting to purchase items that are useless or causing further harm to his community (take a few M16s to the hood, pass em all out to the block)- literally misusing his influence. Second verse is Kendrick rapping as uncle Sam wanting to exploit Kendrick by enticing him to buy more and more expensive items until he has to pay taxes for all these items.

The song’s title may be a nod to Wesley Snipes. The actor was embroiled in a tax fraud case throughout the 2000s and served a three-year jail sentence from 2010 to 2013. The U.S. Government stated Snipes was using “tax protester theory” in an attempt to get out of his charges. Lamar basically argues that what happened to Wesley snipes wasn’t just a mistake, but on purpose because the government encourages (black) people to spend beyond their means. 

Briefly, Kendrick brought his survival of Compton to the present to explain to everyone where he came from. He had to change or omit certain things to allow his listeners to feel such a state of euphoria. Something that at the time, Kendrick would not have felt. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Kendrick+Lamar/_/Wesley%27s+Theory"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Velvet Elvis Lyrics
“Velvet Elvis” has an internal rhyme that makes it catchy and poetic. Kacey puts a new twist on being in love. Her man makes her feel good and she wants him around no matter where she goes.
[Verse 1]
All I ever wanted was something classic
The kind of love song that goes on 'til the end of time
All I ever wanted was a little magic
With a good laugh, jet-black sparkle in his eyes
[Chorus]
You're my velvet Elvis, I ain't never gonna take you down
Making everybody jealous when they step into my house
Soft to the touch, feels like love, knew it as soon as I felt it
You're my velvet Elvis, baby
[Verse 2]
I don't really care 'bout the Mona Lisa
I need a Graceland kind of man who's always on my mind
I wanna show you off every evening
Go out with you in powder blue and tease my hair up high
[Chorus]
You're my velvet Elvis, I ain't never gonna take you down
Making everybody jealous when they step into my house
Soft to the touch, feels like love, knew it as soon as I felt it
You're my velvet Elvis, baby
You're my velvet Elvis, baby
[Bridge]
I knew it as soon as I felt it
Mm-mm, I knew it as soon as I felt it

No one knows me yet, not right now
But I am bound to set this feeling in motion
I walk the downtown, hear my sound

Don't fight it, fight it

This is my dancefloor I fought for
A heart, that's what I'm livin' for
So light up my body and kiss me too hardly
We own the downtown, hear our sound

[Intro]
(Ah)
[Verse 1]
I'll remember you this way
Keep you safe inside my memory
But I’ve held you here for far too long
I wonder if you think of me
I'm still putting up a fight
While you're off and you’re forgetting me
Never got the chance to tell our story
A tale as old as time
[Pre-Chorus]
Where did you go?
Is it something I said? (Something I said)
Why am I alone in this bed?
[Chorus]
Tell me the truth
What did I do?
Look at me
Why can't I see?
No, it can't be this easy
To let me go
But if you say so
Guess I make love too dangerous[Post-Chorus]
Mm-mm
[Verse 2]
Right when I think I hate you
Something pulls me under like the tide
Even picked a house and chose our kids' names
You'd always be mine
[Pre-Chorus]
Where did you go?
Is it something I said? (Something I said)
Why am I alone in this bed?
[Chorus]
Tell me the truth
What did I do?
Look at me
Why can't I see?
No, it can't be this easy
To let me go
But if you say so
Guess I make love too dangerous
[Bridge]
Ooh
I do[Chorus]
Tell me the truth
What did I do?
Look at me
Why can't I see?
No, it can’t be this easy

I’m currently in my third long-term relationship and I’ve done a lot of self-reflection over the last two years – a whole lot of therapy, a whole lot of spiritual endeavors, and just learning about myself. Part of that, for me, has been to reflect. There have been times where I was like, “Is it me?” When you’re, like, the common denominator in something, am I the trauma? It’s one of those things where I had a moment of self-reflection. Being the dramatic Pisces I am, I definitely had times thinking, “Maybe I’m unlovable?” and I think we all go through phases of that. I’ve learned through therapy and a lot of love for myself, that I’m not, and I’m not too dangerous to love, but this song is about that feeling when you’re in that headspace. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Madison+Beer/_/Dangerous"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

She's a wonder woman
She knows what she likes
Never know she's broken
'Cause she's always fine
She's a million moments
Lived a thousand lives
Never know she's hopeless
Only when she cries

When her favorite record's on and she's dancin' in the dark
She can't stop her eyes from wellin' up, up
She makes sure that no one's 'round to see her fall apart
She wants to be thе one that never doеs

She's a won't-stop woman
Hours on her hands
All the pain is polished
All the tears are planned

The slow piano production used in the song creates a melancholic atmosphere that can tug at the heartstrings of the listeners, perfectly matching the introspective and sorrowful lyrics. Miley’s emotive vocals blend seamlessly with the gentle yet haunting notes of the piano, enhancing the somber ambiance of the track. The slow tempo of the song allows for a deep dive into the emotions of the lyrics, and Miley’s voice effectively conveys the pain and vulnerability, making the listeners feel connected to the persona’s experiences.

“Wonder Woman” can be highly reminiscent of some of Miley’s notable tracks like, “Slide Away,” “The Climb,” “Wrecking Ball,” “Adore You,” and “Malibu,” which have a similar theme about perseverance and personal growth, which are also present in the song. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Miley+Cyrus/_/Wonder+Woman"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

[Verse 1]
Are you
Someone that I can give my heart to?
Or just the poison that I'm drawn to?
It can be hard to tell the difference late at night
Play fair
Is that a compass in your nature?
Or are you tricky? 'Cause I've been there
And, baby, I don't need to learn my lesson twice
[Pre-Chorus]
But if you really wanna go there
You should know I
[Chorus]
Need someone to hold me close
Deeper than I've ever known
Whose love feels like a rodeo
Knows just how to take control
When I'm vulnerable
He's straight talking to my soul
Convеrsation overload
Got me feeling vertigo
[Post-Chorus]
Arе you somebody who can go there?
'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya
If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah
'Cause training season's over
(Training season's over)[Verse 2]
I tried
To see my lovers in a good light
Don't wanna do it just to be nice
Don't wanna have to teach you how to love me right
I hope
It hits me like an arrow
Someone with some potential
Is it too much to ask for?
[Pre-Chorus]
Who understands I
[Chorus]
Need someone to hold me close
Deeper than I've ever known
Whose love feels like a rodeo

Can you compete? Now is your time
Run when you hear that whistle blow
Are you on my team or stuck on the sidelines
Waiting for someone to tell you to go?
For someone to tell you to go

You should know I

Need someone to hold me close
Deeper than I've ever known

The singer previously teased the song title through a picture she shared on Instagram, wearing a sweater with the caption ""Training Season"" during a rehearsal. On 24 January 2024 Lipa shared an instrumental snippet of the song through WhatsApp. She announced the single the following day through her social media. Written by Lipa, along with Caroline Ailin, Danny L Harle, Tobias Jesso Jr., and Kevin Parker, the song was produced by the latter and Harle.

On 25 January, Lipa shared a clip of ""Training Season"" on TikTok. Its lyrics, which she conceived after going on mediocre dates, are about her denouncing unimpressive suitors. The clip featured Lipa singing lyrics over a pounding beat: ""I need someone to hold me close, deeper than I've ever known/ Whose love feels like a rodeo, knows just how to take control."" She elaborated on the dual meaning of its lyrics, stating that it is about both informing men that she will no longer be training them about how to treat her as well as the completion of her own personal growth. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Dua+Lipa/_/Training+Season"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

A job that slowly kills you
Bruises that won't heal
You look so tired, unhappy
Bring down the government
They don't, they don't speak for us
I'll take a quiet life
A handshake of carbon monoxide

And no alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
Silent, silent

This is my final fit
My final bellyache with

No alarms and no surprises

It was released as the third and final single from the group's 1997 album ""OK Computer"". Accompanied by a music video that featured a single shot of singer Thom Yorke's head in a plastic bubble that filled with water, the single peaked at number four in the United Kingdom.

Radiohead wrote ""No Surprises"" while touring with the band R.E.M. in 1995. ""No Surprises"" was the first song Radiohead recorded on the first day of recording sessions for OK Computer. The version of the song on the album is the first take recorded. Singer Thom Yorke commented, ""We did endless versions afterwards [...] and they were all just covers of the first version. So we gave up and went back to [the original].""

The lyrics originally told the story of a man who has become fed up with the way things are working out for him and is having problems with his girlfriend. Two lines from this version are, ""He was sick of her excuses / To not take off her dress when bleedin' in the bathroom."" Preparing to record the song, Yorke altered the lyrics dramatically; instead of telling a love story about a man and his girlfriend, the song now appears to figuratively reference taking one's own life (as evidenced in lyrics such as ""I'll take a quiet life/A handshake/Of carbon monoxide"") to illustrate contempt for the complacency of British ""normality"".

""No Surprises"" was released as the third single from OK Computer on 12 January 1998. The single reached number four on the UK Singles Chart.

The music video for ""No Surprises"" was directed by Grant Gee. The video consists solely of a single close-up shot of Thom Yorke's head inside a clear plastic bubble. The lyrics to the song scroll backwards on the bottom of the screen throughout the video. After the first verse, the plastic helmet begins to fill with water. Yorke continues singing as he attempts to lift his head above the rising water. Once the bubble completely fills, Yorke is motionless for over a minute, after which the water is released and he resumes singing. For Yorke's safety, the video was filmed at high-speed and played back in slow-motion.

""No Surprises"" was used in the opening episode of the 6th season of House, that shows Hugh Laurie's character suffering from pain due to Vicodin withdrawals. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/_/No+Surprises"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

“Crash My Party” is the titular track and first single from Luke Bryan’s fourth studio album.
[Verse 1]
It don't matter what plans I got, I can break 'em
Yeah, I can turn this thing around at the next red light
And I don't mind tellin' all the guys I can't meet 'em
Hell, we can all go raise some hell on any other night
Girl, I don't care, oh, I just gotta see what you're wearin'
Your hair, is it pulled up or fallin' down?
Oh, I just have to see it now
[Chorus]
If you wanna call me, call me, call me (
Call me, call me, call me
)
You don't have to worry 'bout it, baby
You can wake me up in the dead of the night
Wreck my plans, baby, that's alright
This is a drop everything kind of thing (
Drop everything
)
Swing on by, I'll pour you a drink
The door's unlocked; I'll leave on the lights
Baby, you can crash my party anytime
[Verse 2]
Ain't a spot downtown that's rockin' the way that you rock me
Ain't a bar that can make me buzz the way that you do
I could be on the front row of the best show
And look down and see your face on my phone
And I'm gone so long, hang on
I'll meet you in a minute or two[Chorus]
If you wanna call me, call me, call me (
Call me, call me, call me
)
You don't have to worry 'bout it, baby
You can wake me up in the dead of the night
Wreck my plans, baby, that's alright
This is a drop everything kind of thing (
Drop everything

Swing on by, I'll pour you a drink
The door's unlocked; I'll leave on the lights
Baby, you can crash my party anytime
[Bridge]
If it's two in the mornin' and you're feelin' lonely
And wonderin' what I'm doing
[Chorus]
Go ahead and call me, call me, call me (
Call me, call me, call me

You don't have to worry 'bout it, baby
You can wake me up in the dead of the night

[Verse 1]
Do you wanna play house? I could be your wife
Go and meet your mom in a dress too tight
Maybe I could stay and not break your heart
But don't forget, baby, I'm a wildcard

I love when you hold me
But loving you is never enough
And don't wait for me
'Cause forever may never come

I'm a wildcard, oh-ooh
Loving you is never enough
I'm a wildcard, oh-ooh
Forever may never come

I walk in the door, with my lips stained red
Pillows on the floor and the flowers dead
Make the music stop before it starts

I want all in, I want all or nothin'
Ooh, it'll cost ya

The lyrics in the chorus emphasize her unpredictability and the fact that loving her may not be enough, and that forever may never come. In the second verse, she describes entering a room with her lips stained red and the flowers dead, indicating that she may have been out late or doing something that is not typical of a committed lover.

However, in the bridge, she expresses her desire for a full commitment, but at a cost, and wants all or nothing. The repeated pre-chorus and chorus lyrics emphasize that she is a wildcard and that love alone may not be enough for her.

Overall, the song seems to be a reflection of Cyrus' own personality and her desire for love but also her fear of commitment and her need for freedom.

[Intro]
(One, two, three, four)
[Chorus]
Daddy doesn't pray anymore
I guess he's finished talkin' to the Lord
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
But Daddy doesn't pray anymore
[Verse 1]
I remember even when the times were bad
He thanked Jesus for everything he had
For a good wife and three children and the food upon our plates
Yeah, everything was right when he said grace
[Chorus]
Daddy doesn't pray anymore
I guess he's finished talkin' to the Lord
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
But Daddy doesn't pray anymore
[Verse 2]
There was a time when we didn't get along
'Cause I thought I was right and he was wrong
Still when I laid down at night, I'd hear him get down on his knees
And say a little prayer for me[Chorus]
Daddy doesn't pray anymore
I guess he's finished talkin' to the Lord
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
But Daddy doesn't pray anymore
[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge]
Today I followed Daddy down to church
And listened to the preacher read God's word
And we sang his favorite hymn, but Daddy didn't make a sound
And this afternoon we'll lay him in the ground
[Chorus]
Daddy doesn't pray anymore
I guess he's finally walkin' with the Lord
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
But Daddy doesn't pray anymore",https://genius.com/Chris-stapleton-daddy-doesnt-pray-anymore-lyrics,"",""

[Verse 1]
Your body laid out on these filthy floors
Your bloodstains on my custom coutures
Bathroom attendant let me right in
She was a big fan
I really tried to stay cool
But your arrogance disturbed my solitude
Now I ripped your dress and you're all black and blue
Look what you made me do
[Refrain]
They keep sayin' that I ain't nothin' like my father
But I'm the furthest thing from choir boys and altars
If you cross me, I'm just like my father
I am colder than Titanic water
[Chorus]
Help me, Lord, from these fantasies in my head
They ain't ever been safe ones
I don't fellowship with these fakе ones
So let's travel to whitе chapels and sing hymns
Hold rosaries, and sing in stained glass symphonies
Cleanse me, 
Holy Trinity
From this marijuana smoke smell in my hair
[Verse 2]
I sashayed my dress
Did my best impression of a damsel in distress
This alcohol and smell of regret
Allured my catch
Outfit too small to hide my scars
Feelin' bottled up like bottle service broads
How long can he hold his breath before his death?[Bridge]
Caro mio ben
Credimi almen
Senza di te
Languisce il cor
Il tuo fedel
Sospira ognor
Cessa, crudel
Tanto rigor
Ooh, ooh
[Chorus]
Help me, Lord, from these fantasies in my head
They ain't ever been safe ones
I don't fellowship with these fake ones
So let's travel to white chapels and sing hymns
Hold rosaries, sing in stained glass symphonies
Cleanse me, Holy Trinity
From this marijuana smoke smell in my hair

Thousand Miles Lyrics
[Verse 1: Miley Cyrus]
Amazing, 
I'm driving 'round town in a beat-up old Mercedes
You think I'm crazy, you might be right
But when he smiles, I don't care about the past
Just like that
[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I told myself I closed that door
But I'm right back here again
I know half of what I'm saying don't make no sense
So don't ask me where I been
[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I'm not always right, but still, I ain't got time for what went wrong
Where I end up, I don't really care
I'm out of my mind, but still, I'm holding on like a 
rolling stone
A thousand miles from anywhere
[Verse 2: Miley Cyrus & Brandi Carlile]
I look in the rearview, I was talking to you 'fore I realize it's madness
Before the sadness
Oh, I pick up the phone and I call back home, but all I get is a dial tone
And instead of hangin' up, I hang my head
[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus & Brandi Carlile]
I told myself I closed that door
But I'm right back here again

I know that's not the way to start a conversation, trouble
I watch 'em other girls when they come and bug you
But I felt like I knew you, so I just wanted to hug you
Plus you don't know your way around
You can stop your playing now
All your worries, lay 'em down, shh, don't say it loud
Is this real, baby?
(Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum)
You're like, ""I love you—,"" who starts a conversation like that? Nobody, but I do
But you are not a picture, I can't cut you up and hide you
I'll get you out my mind, mhm, or try to
But I just want to stand and yell
I will never dare to tell
Think I heard some wedding bells, shh, keep it to yourself
Is this real? (Is this real?)[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Don't wanna wake up
Wake up (Oh, no), wake up, wake up
'Cause you're such a dream
If you can believe
You're such a dream to me, mm, boy
[Verse 3: Ariana Grande & 
Pharrell Williams
]
I could buy you anything, but I cannot buy you
Before your boy gets smart, I would never try to
You know I'm thinking to myself, ""What happened? Why you?""
But when I see you in my dreams, shh, I know
You know how to treat it, you know how to eat it
You know how to beat it (
I know how to keep it
)
The Good Housekeeping Seal
(Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum)
I don't just wanna touch you
I'm tryna turn two single people into a couple
What's your next month like? Tell me what you're up to
We can leave right now, boy, you don't need a duffel
What about La Perla? Let Vickie keep her secret
Boy, it ain't no secret if I know you're gonna peep it (Ooh, hey)[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wa-wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wa-wake up
(No, I don't want, no)
'Cause you're such a dream (
Does this end?

I feel my luck could change
Kill me, Sarah
Kill me again with love

Pull me out of the lake

""Lucky"" was recorded in five hours with the producer Nigel Godrich. Radiohead included it on their third studio album, OK Computer, and released it as a single in France in December 1997.

From Ed's sweet, tingling, opening riff, the rest of ""Lucky"" was generated. ""I remember fiddling around in the sound check,"" he says. ""[We] were in Japan- and putting together a different pedal order and actually hitting the strings above the nut on the headstock. The pedals that I did it with, and the delay that was going on. It was one of those moments -'Yeah, this is pretty cool'"" From here, ""Lucky"" was made into what the band considers a ""happy"" song, or at least as happy a song as they are capable of creating. An identical version, which can be found on both the Help! compilation and the Help! EP, also appears on OK Computer. This wasn't the plan: the band did try to remix the track for the third album but found they couldn't improve on it. 

In 1995, Radiohead were on tour, promoting their second album, The Bends. During soundchecks for shows in Japan, guitarist Ed O'Brien produced a high-pitched sound by strumming above the guitar nut. The band developed the sound into a song, ""Lucky"", which became part of the set list.

Around this time, the producer Brian Eno asked Radiohead to contribute a song to The Help Album, a charity compilation organised by the charity War Child. The album was to be recorded in a single day, 4 September 1995, and rush-released that week. Radiohead recorded ""Lucky"" in five hours with engineer Nigel Godrich, who had assisted producer John Leckie with The Bends and produced several Radiohead B-sides Godrich went on to produce their third album, OK Computer. He said of the Help Album session: ""Those things are the most inspiring, when you do stuff really fast and there's nothing to lose. We left feeling fairly euphoric.""

Yorke later said ""Lucky"" shaped the nascent sound and mood of OK Computer. He said: ""'Lucky' was indicative of what we wanted to do. It was like the first mark on the wall."" <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/_/Lucky"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Do you want me or do you not?
I heard one thing, now I'm hearing another
Dropped a pin to my parking spot
The bar was hot, it's 2 AM, it feels like summer
[Refrain 1]
Happiness is a butterfly
Try to catch it, like, every night
It escapes from my hands into moonlight
Every day is a lullaby
Hum it on the phone, like, every night
Sing it for my babies on the tour life, ah
[Pre-Chorus]
If he's a serial killer, then what's the worst
That can happen to a girl who's already hurt?
I'm already hurt
If he's as bad as they say, then I guess I'm cursed
Looking into his eyes, I think he's already hurt
He's already hurt
[Chorus]
I said, ""Don't be a jerk, don't call me a taxi""
Sitting in your sweatshirt, crying in the backseat, ooh
I just wanna dance with you
Hollywood and Vine, Black Rabbit in the alley
I just wanna hold you tight down the avenue
I just wanna dance with you
I just wanna dance with you[Post-Chorus]
Baby, I just wanna dance (Dance)
With you (Dance)
Baby, I just wanna dance (Dance)
With you
[Verse 2]
Left the canyon, drove to the club
I was one thing, now I'm being another
Laurel down to Sunset in the truck
I'll pick you up if you're in town on the corner, ah
[Refrain 2]
Happiness is a butterfly
We should catch it while dancing
I lose myself in the music, baby
Every day is a lullaby
Try to catch it like lightning
I sing it into my music, I'm crazy

If he's a serial killer, then what's the worst
That can happen to a girl who's already hurt?
I'm already hurt
If he's as bad as they say, then I guess I'm cursed

Good mornin', this ain't Vietnam, still
People lose hands, legs, arms, for real
Little was known of Sierra Leone
And how it connect to the diamonds we own
When I speak of diamonds in this song
I ain't talkin' 'bout the ones that be glowin', I'm talkin' 'bout Roc-a-Fella, my home
My chain, these ain't conflict diamonds
Is they, Jacob? Don't lie to me, mane
See, a part of me sayin' keep shinin'
How when I know what a blood diamond is?
Though it's thousands of miles away
Sierra Leone connect to what we go through today
Over here, it's a drug trade, we die from drugs
Over there, they die from what we buy from drugs
The diamonds, the chains, the bracelets, the charmses
I thought my Jesus piece was so harmless
'Til I seen a picture of a shorty armless
And here's the conflict
It's in a black person soul to rock that gold
Spend your whole life tryna get that ice
On a Polo rugby, it look so nice
How can somethin' so wrong make me feel so right?
Right? 'Fore I beat myself up like Ike
You can still throw your Roc-a-Fella diamond tonight, because[Chorus: Kanye West &

The chain remains, the gang is intact (Uh-huh)
The name is mine, I'll take blame for that
The pressure's on, but guess who ain't gon' crack?
Haha, pardon me, I had to laugh at that
How could you falter when you're the Rock of Gibraltar?
I had to get off the boat so I could walk on water
This ain't no tall order, this is nothin' to me
Difficult takes a day, impossible takes a week
I do this in my sleep, I sold kilos of coke (So?)
I'm guessin' I can sell CDs
I'm not a businessman, I'm a business, man
Let me handle my business, damn

Bleek could be one hit away his whole career
As long as I'm alive, he's a millionaire
And even if I die, he's in my will somewhere
So he could just kick back and chill somewhere, oh, yeah
He won't even have to write rhymes
The Dynasty like my money: last three lifetimes
Shirley Bassey's in the rear, sayin' exactly
What I been sayin' practically my whole career
The diamond is forever, I've been minin' this forever
Now the Louis Vuitton Don's timin' couldn't be better
People lined up to see the Titanic sinkin'
Instead, we rose up from the ash like a phoenix
If you're waitin' for the end of the Dynasty sign
It would seem like forever is a mighty long time

Hours before the album’s release, Travis used this song title along with other ASTROWORLD tracks, consisting of “NC-17,” “STARGAZING,” and “STOP TRYING TO BE GOD” to promote the album on his now-expired Instagram story. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Travis+Scott/_/NO+BYSTANDERS"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Constantly aware of it all
My lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world

When it's only in my memory, it don't hit me quite the same
Maybe it's a cause for concern, but I'm not at ease
Keeping my head to the curb

Pray to catch you whispering

[Verse 1]
Nine in the morning, the man drops his kids off at school
And he's thinking of you, like all of us do
Sends his assistant for coffee in the afternoon
Around 1:32, like he knows what to do
[Chorus]
She (She), she lives in daydreams with me (She)
She's the first one that I see, and I don't know why
I don't know who she is (She, she)
[Verse 2]
He takes a boat out, imagines just sailing away (Away, away)
And not telling his mates (Not telling his mates)
He wouldn't know what to say (Wouldn't know what to say, to say)
[Chorus]
She (She), she lives in daydreams with me (She)
She's the first one that I see, and I don't know why
I don't know who she is (She)
She (She), she's the first one that I see (She)
She lives in daydreams with me, and I don't know why
I don't know where she is (She, she)
[Bridge]
Lives for the memory
A woman who's just in his head (Just in his head)
And she sleeps in his bed (His bed)
While he plays pretend (Pretend)
So pretend (Pretend)[Chorus]
She (She), she lives in daydreams with me (She)
She's the first one that I see, and I don't know why
I don't know who she is (She, she)
She (She), she's the first one that I see (She)
She lives in daydreams with me, and I don't know why
I don't know where she is (She, she)

Harry Styles channels a character who is fantasizing about his ideal girl. A married office worker, his daydreams liven up his humdrum existence.

Harry experimented with magic mushrooms during the recording of ""Fine Line"". The former One Direction star admitted to Rolling Stone that he took the hallucinogenic drug at a LA recording studio and bit the end of his tongue off while under the influence. ""She,"" which he wrote with his guitar sidekick Mitch Rowland, was penned while they were taking them.

""We had no idea what we were doing,"" he recalled. ""We forgot all about that track, then went back later and loved it.

Then I will remember
Things we said today

Don’t Call Tonight Lyrics
[Intro]
Don't call tonight, don’t call tonight, don't call tonight
[Verse 1]
I can't believe all the things that you said
To me tonight, to me tonight, to me tonight
Stars are descending, the streets signs go by
A lonely ride, I need to cry to feel alive
[Pre-Chorus]
You pull me close and knock me down
Then I beg to come back around
I’m so addicted to your lies, oh
And in the mirror I get weak
At the girl starin' back at me
They're your eyes, they're your eyes
[Chorus]
Don't call tonight, unless you wanna hurt me
Don't call tonight, it's not because you care
Don't call tonight, tomorrow, you’ll desert mе
I can hear everything you’rе sayin' from here
[Post-Chorus]
Don’t call tonight, don't call tonight[Verse 2]
Saturday morning, my head is on fire
It's hard to blame you for your crimes when I have mine
The sun is risin', but we’re out of light
We twist the knife too many times to say goodbye
[Pre-Chorus]
You pull me close and knock me down
Then I beg to come back around
I'm so addicted to your lies, oh
And in the mirror, I get weak
At the girl starin' back at me
They're your eyes, they're your eyes
[Chorus]
Don't call tonight, unless you wanna hurt me
Don't call tonight, it's not because you care
Don't call tonight, tomorrow, you'll desert me
I can hear everything you're sayin' from here

Don't call tonight, don't call tonight, don't call tonight
Oh-oh, oh
Don't call tonight, don't call tonight, don't call tonight

Drivin' home to your favorite song
And you scream so loud, 'cause you're all alone
And your heart beats fast 'cause you're in the zone
And you know you're right where you belong
Drivin' home to your favorite song
And you scream so loud, 'cause you're all alone
And your heart beats fast 'cause you're in the zone
And then you hear the phone[Chorus]
Don't call tonight, unless you wanna hurt me
Don't call tonight, it's not because you care

[Verse 1]
New to town with a made-up name
In the angel's city, chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
So overnight, you look like a sixties queen

Another name goes up in lights
Like diamonds in the sky

Now, it’s big black cars and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesn’t even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that you’re lucky, but you’re so confused
'Cause you don’t feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place[Pre-Chorus 2]
Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if you’ll make it out alive
[Chorus 1]
And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
But can you tell me now, you’re the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh
[Verse 3]
It was a few years later, I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the rose garden over Madison Square
And it took some time, but I understand it now
[Pre-Chorus 3]
'Cause now, my name is up in lights
But I think you got it right
[Chorus 2]
Let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one

According to producer Phil Ramone, Joel had written the music and had decided he liked the title ""Zanzibar"" for the piece, but had not figured out what to say about Zanzibar. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Billy+Joel/_/Zanzibar"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","""Zanzibar"" is a song written by Billy Joel that first appeared on his 1978 album 52nd Street. It has also appeared on several live albums. It is particularly notable for the jazz trumpet breaks played by Freddie Hubbard. 

The themes of ""Zanzibar"" include love of sports, love of alcohol and the singer's attempt to pick up a waitress. According to producer Phil Ramone, Joel had written the music and had decided he liked the title ""Zanzibar"" for the piece, but had not figured out what to say about Zanzibar. Hearing the music conjured up for Ramone images of people watching television in a bar, and as a result Joel decided to make the song about activity in a sports bar named Zanzibar rather than about the country Zanzibar. The lyrics include a number of contemporary sports references, including to heavyweight champion boxer Muhammad Ali, baseball player Pete Rose, and the baseball team the New York Yankees, who were the World Champions at the time. The lyrics also use a baseball expression as a sexual metaphor when the singer wants to steal second base with a waitress in the bar if the waitress will allow it. Joel biographer Hank Bordowitz considers the waitress to be a metaphor for Joel's first wife Elizabeth, similar to how he considers the waitress ""practicing politics"" in Joel's earlier song ""Piano Man"" to be a metaphor for Elizabeth.
The song begins with a short slow section, but then moves to a shuffle rhythm. It contains two jazz trumpet solos played by the legendary jazz trumpeter Freddie Hubbard. The song's bridge begins with a ""dreamy"" keyboard section, which leads into the first trumpet solo. According to Ramone, the urgency and sexiness of the trumpet part is enhanced by the ascending and descending line played on bass guitar beneath the solo. The second solo comes at the end of the song and goes into the fades out. Of playing with Hubbard, Joel stated that it ""was a special treat for me, because I've always admired and respected jazz players."" Joel also recalled that after playing with Hubbard on the song, drummer Liberty DeVitto claimed that ""Now I feel like a grown up."" Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine considers the melody of ""Zanzibar"" to be homage to Steely Dan's Donald Fagen.

Ramone claims that he convinced Joel to experiment with creating a jazz mood on the 52nd Street album based on the fact that Joel had written some jazz riffs into the end of ""Zanzibar."" Billy Joel biographer Mark Bego claims that ""If 52nd Street is Billy's tribute to jazz, then 'Zanzibar' is its centerpiece."" ""Zanzibar"" was the third most played album cut from ""52nd Street"" on U.S. album-oriented rock radio during 1979 according to the year-end R&R Top 79 Albums of 1979 chart. 

""Zanzibar"" has often featured in Joel's live concerts. Since 2005 the trumpet solos have been performed by Carl Fischer. Live performances have been included on the 2006 album 12 Gardens Live and the 2008 album Live at Shea Stadium: The Concert. A live performance also appears in the video The Last Play at Shea. In later performances, Joel alters the lyrics about Pete Rose, reflecting his ban from baseball resulting from gambling allegations. Instead of singing of Rose being ""a credit to the game,"" Joel jokes that he will ""never make the Hall of Fame.""
""Zanzibar"" was also included on the compilation album My Lives. The version on My Lives contains different trumpet solos performed by Hubbard. In addition, this version does not fade out the second trumpet solo that ends the song, providing an extra minute and a half of Hubbard's playing. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Billy+Joel/_/Zanzibar"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

[Chorus]
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you
[Verse 1]
Something don't feel right because it ain't right
Especially comin' up after midnight
I smell your secrets, and I'm not too perfect
To ever feel this worthless
How did it come down to this? Scrolling through your call list
I don't wanna lose my pride, but I'ma fuck me up a bitch
Know that I kept it sexy, you know I kept it fun
There's something that I'm missing, maybe my head for one

What's worst, lookin' jealous or crazy? Jealous or crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you[Verse 2]
Let's imagine for a moment that you never made a name for yourself
Or mastered wealth, they had you labeled as a king
Never made it out the cage, still out there movin' in them streets
Never had the baddest woman in the game up in your sheets
Would they be down to ride? No
They used to hide from you, lie to you
But y'all know we were made for each other
So I find you and hold you down
Me sing se

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you

Hey, this such a shame
You let this good love go to waste
I always keep the top tier, five-star
Backseat lovin' in the car
Like make that wood, like make that wood
Holly like a boulevard[Refrain]

Hillbilly blood, runnin' through my veins
Black cold soul and a mountain of pain
Jug of white lightning crossin' my lips
Hillbilly blood don't give a shit

Hillbilly blood, the river runs red
Finger on the trigger and a pound of lead
Chopper in the air, searchin' my land
A copperhead bites I don't give a goddamn

All the tongues at the tent revival
Been spittin' in the devil's eye
There ain't livin', there's just survival
Doesn't matter if you do or die
The way it is, is the way it was
Hillbilly blood, hillbilly blood

Hillbilly blood, thick as the night
Fog lays heavy on the mornin' light
Pike County Sheriff trackin' my scent
Nobody gonna know wherе it went[Chorus]
All the tongues at thе tent revival
Been spittin' in the devil's eye
There ain't livin', there's just survival
Doesn't matter if you do or die
And the way it is, is the way it was

Shadow Of A Man Lyrics

Dance in the shadow of a m—

Starin' at myself in the eye (Oh, oh-oh)

When I get this feelin'
I can't get enough

I don't wanna fade into the darkness tonight
Show me the light
I don't wanna be the one to fall on the knife
To come alive
I'm about to be there, I'm about to be there
Watch me, I swear
I'll dance in the shadow of a man[Verse 2]
Hard to be the yellow in a purple sky (Sky)
Peekin' through the eye of the storm (Eye of the storm)
Gotta be the truth or you'll become a lie (Become a lie)
Piercing like your skin from a thorn (Oh, oh, I)
[Pre-Chorus]
When I get this feelin'
I can't get enough
'Cause I start believin'
And my voice gets tough
Now I got this feelin'
I can't get enough
'Cause I won't be used for my love and left out to cry
[Chorus]
I don't wanna fade into the darkness tonight
Show me the light
I don't wanna be the one to fall on the knife
To come alive
I'm about to be there, I'm about to be there
Watch me, I swear
I'll dance in the shadow of a man
[Post-Chorus]
Sha-da-do, sha-da-do-ow (Shadow of a man)
Sha-da-do, sha-da-do-ow of a man
Sha-da-do, sha-da-do-ow (Shadow of a man)
Dance in the shadow of a man[Bridge]
Can't ignore the voice within
And a woman can't lose, but you still pretend
Can't ignore the voice within
And a woman can't lose, but you still pretend
Can't ignore the voice within
And a woman can't lose, but you still pretend
'Cause I won't be used for my love and left out to cry

I don't wanna fade into the darkness tonight
Show me the light

I'm 'bout to come alive
I'm about to be there, I'm about to be there

[Verse 1]
Feelin' something that I can't explain (Oh)
Think it's a wound I still entertain (Oh)
I'd do anything to numb the flame (Oh)
I guess I'm just on fire these days (Oh)
[Pre-Chorus]
I can't see straight, I can't see me
There's too much hurt caught in between
Wish I could be what I know I am
This moment's hijacked my plans
[Chorus]
I'm feelin' the way that I'm feelin', I'm feelin' with you (
Ooh, ooh

I stare at the girl in the mirror, she talks to me too
Yeah, I can see it in your face

Maybe it's time for us to say goodbye 'cause
I'm feelin' the way that I'm feelin', I'm feelin' with you
I'm not havin' fun tonight

You love the paparazzi, love the fame
Even though you know it causes me pain
I feel like I'm in a prison hell
Stick my hands through the steel bars and yell[Pre-Chorus]
What happens now? I'm not okay
And if I scream, you walk away
When I'm sad, you just wanna play
I've had enough, why do I stay?
[Chorus]
I'm feelin' the way that I'm feelin', I'm feelin' with you (
Ooh, ooh

I stare at the girl in the mirror, she talks to me too

[Intro]
Rain
He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight
[Verse 1]
My town was a wasteland
Full of cages, full of fences
Pageant queens and big pretenders
But for some, it was paradise
My boy was a montage
A slow-motion, love potion
Jumping off things in the ocean
I broke his heart 'cause he was nice
He was sunshine, I was midnight rain
[Chorus]
He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight
[Verse 2]
It came like a postcard
Picture perfect shiny family
Holiday peppermint candy
But for him, it's every day
So I peered through a window
A deep portal, time travel
All the love we unravel
And the life I gave away
'Cause he was sunshine, I was midnight rain[Chorus]
He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight rain
He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight
[Outro]
I guess sometimes we all get
Just what we wanted, just what we wanted
And he never thinks of me
Except for when I'm on TV
I guess sometimes we all get
Some kind of haunted, some kind of haunted
And I never think of him
Except on midnights like this

Falling Forever Lyrics
[Intro]
How long? How long?
[Verse 1]
Are you good at holding on?
I know the mind is quick to throw away the moment
Where this takes us, maybe I don't wanna know yet
'Cause for now, you're all I want
They say you got it, then it's gone
I don't believe that every flame has to get colder
I hope the feelings that you give me carry over
Till tomorrow and beyond
[Chorus]
How long, how long
Can it just keep getting better?
Can we keep falling forever?
How long, how long
Can we stay like this together?
Can we keep falling forever?
[Verse 2]
You could wake up all alone
So tonight, I'll give you something to remember
And eternity's impossible to measure
But it feels right where we are[Pre-Chorus]
I'm (
I'm
) falling deep (
Falling deep
)
Deep in your arms, baby
Baby, I'm yours to keep
Keep me close
Till tomorrow and beyond
[Chorus]
How long, how long
Can it just keep getting better?
Can we keep falling forever?
How long, how long
Can we stay like this together?
Can we keep falling forever?
[Bridge]
(How long)
I wanna know
Can you ride through any storm?
Can you ride from night till dawn?
Till tomorrow and beyond
[Chorus]
How long, how long
Can it just keep getting better?
Can we keep falling forever?
How long, how long
Can we stay like this together?
Can we keep falling forever?[Outro]

Can it just keep getting better?
Can we keep falling forever?

[Intro]
We once had things in common
Now, the only thing we share is the refrigerator
Ice cold, baby, I told you, I'm ice cold (Ice cold)
You out here flyin' high 
(
High
)
Huh, go 'head, fly that thing
High, high, yeah
But fly alone
[Verse 1]
You always smokin' in the house
What if my mother comes over?
You can't get up and get a job
'Cause this little hustle's gettin' you by
You're the dealer and the stoner
With the sweetest kiss I've ever known
[Chorus]
I know what I was on
I had a Pilot Jones (What you know about her?)
She took me high (Oh, did she now?)
Then she took me home (We talkin' 'bout)
Pilot Jones, Pilot Jones
[Verse 2]
Tonight, she came stumblin' across my lawn again
I just don't know why I keep on tryna keep a grown woman sober
See, there you go reachin' up your blouse
And no, I don't want a child
But I ain't been touched in a while
By the dealer and the stoner
With the sweetest kiss I've ever known[Chorus]
I know what I was on (Ever known, 
we'll fly, fly
)
I had a Pilot Jones (
We'll fly, fly, fly,
 what you know about her?)
She took me high (
We'll be here flyin',
 oh, did she now?)
Then she took me home (
Oh,
 we talkin' 'bout)
Pilot Jones, Pilot Jones
[Outro]
In the sky up above, the birds
I saw the sky like I've never seen before, yeah
Thought I was above you
Above this in so many ways
But if I got a condo on a cloud
Then I guess you can stay at my place

Alternatively, a pilot episode is the first in any line of a TV series, hinting at this being a first love.

[Verse 1]
Well, you went uptown
Ridin' in your limousine
With your fine Park Avenue clothes
You had the Dom Perignon
In your hand
And the spoon up your nose
Ooh, and when you
Wake up in the mornin'
With your head on fire
And your eyes too bloody to see
Go on and cry in your coffee
But don't come bitchin' to me
[Chorus]
Because you had to be
A big shot, didn't cha
You had to open up your mouth
You had to be a big shot, didn't cha
All your friends were so knocked out
You had to have the last word, last night
You know what everything's about
You had to have a white hot spotlight
You had to be a big shot last night, whoa
Yeah[Verse 2]
And they were all impressed
With your Halston dress
And the people that you knew at Elaine's
And the story of your latest success
You kept 'em so entertained
But now you just don't
Remember all the things you said
And you're not sure that you want to know
I'll give you one hint, honey
You sure did put on a show
[Chorus]
Yes, yes, you had to be
A big shot, didn't cha
You had to prove it to the crowd
You had to be a big shot, didn't cha
All your friends were so knocked out
You had to have the last word, last night
You're so much fun to be around
You had to have the front page, bold type
You had to be a big shot last night
[Verse 3]
Well, it's no big sin
To stick your two cents in
If you know when to leave it alone
But you went over the line
You couldn't see it was time to go home
No, no, no, no, no, no[Chorus]
You had to be a big shot, didn't cha
You had to open up your mouth
You had to be a big shot, didn't cha

You had to have the last word, last night
You're so much fun to be around

The song is superficially about the protagonist mocking a woman with a severe hangover for her intoxicated escapades around town, making numerous social and verbal faux pas while high on alcohol and drugs (""But now you just don't remember all the things you said / And you're not sure you want to know / I'll give you one hint, honey; you sure did put on a show!"") The song makes reference to late 1970s nouveau riche fads such as Elaine's restaurant and Halston.

During a Q&A session at Florida State University in 1996, Joel stated the song is about someone he was very close to, and also about himself. In an interview in 2006, Billy Joel said, ""I read that the song 'Big Shot' is said to be about a date I had with Bianca Jagger. I never had a date with Bianca Jagger."" But in an interview with Howard Stern on 16 November 2010, Joel said the song was written after having dinner with Mick and Bianca Jagger. Joel told Stern that while writing the lyrics to ""Big Shot,"" he was thinking of Mick singing the song to Bianca.

Billboard Magazine described ""Big Shot"" as ""an upbeat rocker"" with ""very contemporary m lyrical content,"" stating that it was driven by ""powerfully rhythmic backing.""

The only change made in the single version is an abridged outro.

The song was made available to download on December 14, 2010 for use in the Rock Band 3 music gaming platform in both Basic rhythm, and PRO mode which allows the use of a real guitar / bass guitar, and MIDI compatible electronic drum kits / keyboards in addition to vocals.

Come on, Harry, we wanna say goodnight to you

Holdin' me back
Gravity's holdin' me back
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
Why don't we leave it at that?
Nothin' to say
When everything gets in the way
Seems you cannot be replaced
And I'm the one who will stay, oh-oh-oh

In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was

Why are you sitting at home on the floor?
What kind of pills are you on?""

And nobody's coming to help
Your daddy lives by himself

You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same

Hush, when no one is around, my dear
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
Hush, I know they said the end is near
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
[Verse 2]
I want you to know
I'm a mirrorball
I can change everything about me to fit in
You are not like the regulars
The masquerade revelers
Drunk as they watch my shattered edges glisten[Chorus]
Hush, when no one is around, my dear
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
Hush, I know they said the end is near
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
[Bridge]
And they called off the circus, burned the disco down
When they sent home the horses and the rodeo clowns
I'm still on that tightrope
I'm still trying everything to get you laughing at me
And I'm still a believer, but I don't know why
I've never been a natural, all I do is try, try, try
I'm still on that trapeze
I'm still trying everything to keep you looking at me

Swift discussed this song in folklore: the long pond studio sessions:

“In folklore, there are a lot of songs that reference each other, or lyrical parallels, and one of the ones I like is the entire song ‘this is me trying’ then being referenced again in ‘mirrorball.’ […] It also is the first time, and one of the only times, that the time that we’re living through is actually lyrically addressed. I think that, you know, the pandemic and lockdown, and all that, runs through this album like a thread because it’s an album that allows you to feel your feelings, and it’s a product of isolation. […] This is the first time, in the bridge saying, ‘they called off the circus, burned the disco down. When they sent home the horses and the rodeo clowns.’ I wrote this song right after I found out all my [Lover] shows were canceled. So it’s like I realize, here I am writing all this music, still trying.“

[Chorus: Kanye West & 
GLC
]
I've been working this grave-shift
And I ain't made shit
 (
Yeah, yeah
)
I wish I could (
Me, too
)
Buy me a spaceship and fly (
I swear I do
)
Past the sky, oh
GLC feel you, Ye—I feel you, man
I've been working this grave-shift
And I ain't made shit
I wish I could
Buy me a spaceship and fly
Past the sky (Man, man, man...)
Oh, oh, oh
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
If my manager insults me again
I will be assaulting him
After I fuck the manager up
Then, I'm gonna shorten the register up
Let's go back, back to the Gap
Look at my check—wasn't no scratch
So if I stole, wasn't my fault
Yeah, I stole—never got caught
They take me to the back and pat me
Asking me about some khakis
But let some Black people walk in
I bet you they show off their token blackie
Oh, now they love Kanye
""Let's put him all in the front of the store""
So I'm on break
Next to the ""No Smoking"" sign with a blunt in the mall
Taking my hits, writing my hits
Writing my rhymes, playing my mind
This fucking job can't help him
So I quit, y'all welcome
Y'all don't know my struggle
Y'all can't match my hustle
You can't catch my hustle
You can't fathom my love, dude
Lock yourself in a room
Doing five beats a day for three summers
That's 
A Different World
 like Cree Summer's
I deserve to do these numbers
""The kid that made that deserves that Maybach!""
So many records in my basement
I'm just waitin' on my spaceship, blaow![Chorus: Kanye West, 
GLC
, & 
Kanye w/ Choir
]
I've been working this grave-shift
And I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly
Past the sky, oh
I've been working this grave-shift
And I ain't made shit
I wish I could 
buy me a spaceship and fly
Past the sky
Tryna tell you, man, way past the sky
Oh, oh
 (
Let's go, ugh
)
[Verse 2: GLC]
And I didn't even try to work a job
Represent the mob at the same time (Woo)
Thirsty on the grind, Chi state of mind
Lost my mama, lost my mind (Aww)
Life, my love, that's not mine
""Why you ain't signed?"" Wasn't my time
Leave me alone, work for y'all
Half of it's yours, half of it's mine
Only wanna ball, never wanna fall (Ugh)
Gotta get mine, gotta take mine (Ugh)
Got a Tec-9, reach my prime (Ugh)
Gotta make these haters respect mine (Yeah)
In the mall 'til 12 when my schedule had said 9
Putting them pants on shelves
Waiting patiently, I ask myself
Where I wanna go, where I wanna be
Life is much more than running in the streets
Holler at 'Ye, hit me with the beat
Put me on my feet, sounds so sweet
Yes, I'm the same ol' G
Same goatee, stayin' low-key, nope
Holler at God: ""Man, why'd You have to take my folks?""
Hope to see Freddie G., 
Yusef G
, love my G
Rolly G, police watch me
Smoke my weed and count my Gs
Got a lot of people counting on me (That's right)
And I'm just tryin' to find my peace (That's right)
Should've finished school like my niece
Then I finally wouldn't use my piece, blaow![Chorus: Kanye West, 
GLC
, & 
Kanye w/ Choir

I've been working this grave-shift
Aww, man, this pressure
And I ain't made shit
I wish I could
Buy me a spaceship and fly
Past the sky
, oh
I've been working this grave-shift
And I ain't made shit
I wish I could
Buy me a spaceship and fly
Past the sky
Oh, oh, oh
[Verse 3: Consequence]
I 'member having to take the dollar cab
Coming home real late at night
Standing on my feet all damn day
Tryna make this thing right
And havin' one of my coworkers say, ""Yo, you look just like
This kid I seen in an old Busta Rhymes video the other night""
Well, easy come, easy go, how that saying goes
No more broad service, cars, and them TV shows
That all had got snatched from me, A&Rs and they faculties
All turn they back on me and didn't wanna hear a rap from me
So naturally, actually, had to face things factually
Had to be a catastrophe, empty fridge is staring back at me
'Cause nothing's there, nothing's fair
I don't wanna ever go back there
So I won't be taking no days off 'til my spaceship takes off, blaow![Chorus: Kanye West & 
Kanye w/ Choir

I've been working this grave-shift
And I ain't made shit
I wish I could
Buy me a spaceship and fly
Past the sky
, oh
I've been working this grave-shift
And I ain't made shit
I wish I could
Buy me a spaceship and fly
Past the sky
Oh, oh, oh

I wanna fly
I wanna fly
I said I want my chariot to pick me up
And take a brother for a ride

Today we escape, we escape

Don't lose your nerve
Breathe, keep breathing
I can't do this alone

Sing us a song
A song to keep us warm
There's such a chill
Such a chill

And you can laugh a spineless laugh

[Verse 1]
Am I asking all these questions for nothing?
I'm wondering if anyone's there, yeah
And I really need to make a confession
I hate to say that I'm a little bit scared, yeah-eh-ehh
[Chorus]
But I've been on this train too long
People getting off and on
Prayin' that I don't forget where I belong
And every time I ask myself
Am I turnin' into someone else?
I'm prayin' that I don't forget just who I am-am
I really wanna understand
I just wanna understand
[Verse 2]
I'm callin' all my friends after midnight, yeah
To remind 'em that I'll always be there for them
It gets lonely when there's no one to talk to
But it's good to know that somebody cares
[Chorus]
'Cause I've been on this train too long
People gettin' off and on
I'm prayin' that I don't forget where I belong
And every time I ask myself
Am I turnin' into someone else?
I'm prayin' that I don't forget just who I am-am
I really wanna understand
I just wanna understand, yeah
Oh, yeah-eh-ehh[Bridge]
'Cause we all get lost sometimes (Yeah-eh, I know)
Yeah, we all get lost sometimes
But don't leave your heart behind, no, yeah-eh
'Cause we all get lost sometimes
I really wanna understand
I just gotta understand, yeah-eh-eh
Now I just need to, I need to understand
I really wanna understand, ohh, who I am
[Interlude]
When you wake up, your whole world's flipped
It's just different, and you gotta, you know, you gotta, you gotta go with it
And that's just simply growing up
And not see it in a negative way
You have to see it as it's been given to you
I mean, as much as times can be crazy
You're gonna feel like that's where you're supposed to be
You're not going to feel out of place anymore
You're going to feel like that's where you were meant to be
You don't have to pretend that it's easy all the time
You just let it go and, and grow with it
And you can't hold on to the old you, or the old this, or the old that
Because, you know, you change, and it's not changing in a bad way
It's just changing because that's what happens in life
You grow up, everyone moves on
You're just learning
You stay true to yourself
Changing isn't a bad thing, it never was
But at the end of the day, you know?
You're the same person
And, and where your heart is, that doesn't change[Chorus]
And every time I ask myself
Am I turning into someone else?
And I just pray to God that I'm still who I am
I really wanna understand
I just gotta understand, yeah-eh-eh-eh-eh

You could find me in the background burning that Backwood
Styling and stunting, doing my two step fronting
Now I'ma tell you what Em told me, homie
Just lose the parental discretion's advised, this is grown folk music
Now blend in with me, as I proceed to break it down
It's always off the chain man when I'm around
I play the block bumping, it was all for the dough
I get the club jumping, cause I'm sick with flow
You know it's sold out, like wherever I go
I jam packed the show man that's fo sho
I got the info you already know
Man, I get it popping in the club, everybody show me love, let's go
[Chorus: 50 Cent]
You know I got
What it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing, turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now, shorty, let's get into it
You, know I got
What it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing, turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now homie, let's get into it[Verse 2: Havoc]
You wanna search me, then search me, but hurry up, 'cause I'm thirsty
I need that, grind in my system P, on my side twisting
In the club today for the chick to go both
Ways, let me see that ID just for proof
With the drink 'til the burn is gone
Hit the dancefloor like a scene from soft porn
Before it pop, make 'em sign a disclaimer
Try to get me on some Pac shit, these tricks'll frame ya (Word)
But, in any event, keep fuckin' with 50 it makes sense
Cents, into them dollars, the hoes wanna holla
But you lookin at a nigga that done came from the squalor
Now my buddy so gone I can pop your collar
Now If I don’t say nothin, let me see you swallow
In my crib got the co-ed back the new problem
In the club, feed them liquor otherwise we starve 'em
So much green gettin twisted like Botanical Garden, let's go
[Chorus: 50 Cent]
You know I got
What it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing, turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now, shorty, let's get into it
You, know I got
What it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing, turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now homie, let's get into it[Verse 3: Prodigy]
You already know how it go, I bang, I shine
I'll play, I stay, I'm going for mine
I'm young, I'm black, I'm rich and yes
I'm ghetto than the motherfucking project steps
I'm cool, I'm calm, you looking real stressed
I'm strapped I'm armed kid, hold your head
I'm known for gat popping, when I got problems
I don't run, I just gun you all up
But we ain't come here to start no drama
We just looking for our future baby mamas
With money with face with style and body
I cook, I clean, I swear that mami
Just as long as you don't go off and tell nobody
I go down low
, 
I'm lying I'm trying my best to let you know
Sugar pop get at P
The Doc beat make it easy to get 'em in the bed sheets

Both versions of the song have ""heavy"" drum-based productions and also incorporate elements of strings throughout, although the remix is produced more sparsely than the original and also prominently features piano keys throughout. Lyrically, the songs are both largely about 50 Cent's ability to control the attitudes of people during his performances in clubs, describing how he has them ""going outta control"".

Due to confusion over which version of the song would be released as a single, both versions of the song charted on the Billboard Hot 100. Though the original peaked at #92 (digital sales alone), the remix was a significant success, peaking at #6 on the Billboard Hot 100 and charting in the upper regions of several national charts worldwide. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/50+Cent/_/Outta+Control"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Skyscraper (Wizz Dumb Remix) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Skies are crying, I am watching
Catching tear drops in my hands
Only silence as it's ending
Like we never had a chance
Do you have to make me feel like there's nothing left of me?
[Chorus]
You can take everything I have
You can break everything I am
Like I'm made of glass
Like I'm made of paper
Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper
[Verse 2]
As the smoke clears
I awaken and untangle you from me
Would it make you feel better to watch me while I bleed?
All my windows still are broken, but I'm standing on my feet
[Chorus]
You can take everything I have
You can break everything I am
Like I'm made of glass
Like I'm made of paper
Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper[Bridge]
Go run, run, run
I'm gonna stay right here
Watch you disappear
Yeah, oh
Go run, run, run
Yeah, it's a long way down
But, I am closer to the clouds up here
[Chorus]
You can take everything I have
You can break everything I am
Like I'm made of glass
Like I'm made of paper, oh, oh
Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground

[Verse 1]
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know
[Pre-Chorus]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said
[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said
[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh
[Bridge]
But I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town and I said
[Chorus]
""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'""[Outro]

It was released as the lead single from her second studio album, Fearless, on September 15, 2008, by Big Machine Records.

The lyrics narrate a troubled romance that ends with a marriage proposal, contrary to Shakespeare's tragic conclusion. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Swift/_/Love+Story"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","""Love Story"" is a song by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift.

Inspired by a boy who was unpopular with her family and friends, Swift wrote the song using William Shakespeare's tragedy Romeo and Juliet as a reference point. The lyrics narrate a troubled romance that ends with a marriage proposal, contrary to Shakespeare's tragic conclusion. Produced by Swift and Nathan Chapman, the midtempo country pop song includes a key change after the bridge and uses acoustic instruments including banjo, fiddle, mandolin, and guitar.

At the time of its release, music critics praised the production but deemed the literary references ineffective. In retrospect, critics have considered it one of Swift's best singles. ""Love Story"" peaked atop the chart in Australia, where it was certified ten-times platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), and reached the top five on charts in Canada, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, Scotland, and the UK. In the U.S., the single peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 and was the first country song to reach number one on the Mainstream Top 40. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified it eight-times platinum. ""Love Story"" has sold over six million copies in the U.S. and 18 million copies worldwide.

Trey Fanjoy directed the accompanying music video, which stars Swift and Justin Gaston as lovers in a prior era. Drawing from historical periods such as the Renaissance and the Regency era, it won Video of the Year at both the Country Music Association Awards and CMT Music Awards in 2009. The song became a staple in Swift's live concerts and has been a part of the set lists in all of her headlining tours from the Fearless Tour (2009–2010) to the Eras Tour (2023). Following the 2019 dispute regarding the ownership of Swift's back catalog, she re-recorded the song and released it as ""Love Story (Taylor's Version)"" in February 2021. The re-recorded single topped the Hot Country Songs chart and made Swift the second artist after Dolly Parton to reach number one with both the original and re-recorded versions of a song. It also reached number one in Malaysia. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Swift/_/Love+Story"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

All that sauce you got from me
All that shit I gave for free

Know you been more than lost
Without me, I'm so
Comin' back, I'm so greasy
Ex-nigga, he so needy
Punk ass tried to replace me, but the stakes is too high
They can't survive off mini-me
I'm talkin' pedigree
Ain't no writers, that's just me
Ain't no spiteful, I'm just tea
Can't hate a bitch for free
Talkin' I'm off the bench like Brady
I'm pressin' niggas like KD, it's up
Yeah, nigga, it's up to me
Remind you of Dеlla Reese
So classic, that ass so fat, it look natural, it's not
I talk bullshit a lot
No more fuck-shit, I'm done
Damn right, I'm thе one
Damn right, I'm the one
Comin' back, she so candid
Comin' back snatched like bandit
Comin' back, this ain't canned shit
I'm organic with my fresh squeezed
I'm dumpin' like press squeeze
I'm horny like, ""Suck these""
So daring like, ""Touch me""
And all the petty shit aside
All the funny shit aside

Mm-mm

If I could make a livin' from walkin' in the woods
You can bet I'd be sittin' pretty good
High on a hill lookin' at a field downwind
If I could make a nickel off of turning 'em bass
Never worry 'bout the price of gas
I'd be wheelin' and dealin' and sittin' there reelin' 'em in

Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day

Thank God, He made me this way

I'm gettin' red dirt rich and Flint River paid
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day

I get a little Farm Pond buzz
Sound of gravel when I'm backin' up
Pullin' the string on a nine point nine two-stroke, Mercury
I love it when my baby wants to roll with me
Throws her boots on, climbs in a tree
Tuckin' her hair in my hat, and she's ready to go[Chorus]
And we get to huntin', fishin', lovin' every day
That's the prayer that a country boy prays
Thank God, He made me this way
Huntin', and fishin' and lovin' every day
Early in the mornin', late in the evenin'
I'm getting red dirt rich, and Flint River paid
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day, yeah
Woo

So while y'all are up there
Breathin' in that old dirty air
I'll be down here, knee-deep, in 
the Muckalee
 (Ha)
Huntin' and fishin', lovin' every day
I wanna see them tall pines sway
Y'all close them eyes
Let's go there in our mind
[Chorus]
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day
That's the prayer this country boy prays
Thank God, He made me this way
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day
Black coffee in the mornin', dark whiskey in the evenin'
I'm gettin' red dirt rich and Flint River paid
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day (Woo)
Come on[Outro]
Won't you come along with me
Won't you come along with me
I know you wanna see

[Verse 1]
Woke up alone in this hotel room
Played with myself, where were you?
Fell back to sleep, I got drunk by noon
I've never felt less cool
[Chorus]
We haven't spoke since you went away
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why won't you ever be the first one to break?
Even my phone misses your call, by the way
[Verse 2]
I saw your friend that you know from work
He said you feel just fine
I see you gave him my old t-shirt
More of what was once mine
[Chorus]
I see it's written, it's all over his face
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why won't you ever say what you want to say?
Even my phone misses your call, by the way
[Bridge]
Maybe one day you'll call me and tell me that you're sorry too
Maybe one day you'll call me and tell me that you're sorry too
Maybe one day you'll call me and tell me that you're sorry too
But you, you never do
Woke up the girl who looked just like you
I almost said your name[Chorus]
We haven't spoke since you went away
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why won't you ever say what you want to say?
Even my phone misses your call
We haven't spoke since you went away
Comfortable silence is so overrated

The music video is available on YouTube:
[Intro]
One, two, three, let's go!
[Chorus]
Lil mama, show me how you move it
Go 'head, put your back into it
Do your thing like it ain't nothing to it
Shake, sh-sh-shake that ass, girl!

Do your thing like it ain't nothing to it
Shake, sh-sh-shake that ass, girl!
[Verse 1]
Go, go, go, 50 in the house, bounce
Y'all already know what I'm about
The flow sound sick over Dre drums, nigga
I ain't stupid, I say Doc then my doe come quicker, whoa!
Shorty hips is hypnotic, she moves is so erotic
I watch her, I'm like, ""Bounce that ass, girl""
I get it crump in here, I make it jump in here
Front in here, we'll thump in here, oh!
So gutter, so ghetto, so hood
So gully, so grimey, what's good
Outside the Benz on dubs, I'm in the club with the snub
Don't start nothing, there won't be nothing, uhh 
(one, two, three, let’s go!)[Chorus]
Lil mama, show me how you move it
Go 'head, put your back into it
Do your thing like it ain't nothing to it

[Bridge]
Let's party! Everybody stand up
Everybody put your hands up
Let's party! Everybody bounce with me
Sip champagne and burn a little greenery
[Verse 2]
It's hot
Disco inferno, let's go
You're now rocking with a pro
I get dough to flip dough, to get more fa sho'
Get my drink on, then get on the dance floor
Look homie, I don't dance, all I do is this
It's the same two-step wit a lil twist
Listen, pimpin', I ain't new to this, I'm true to this
Pay attention, boy, I'll teach you how to do this shit
You mix a little Cris' with a little Dom Perignon
And a little Hennessy, you know we finna carry on
I'm hollering at these shorties in the club trying to get right
We gon' be up in this bitch till we break daylight (daylight) 
(one, two, three, let’s go!)[Chorus]
Lil mama, show me how you move it
Go 'head, put your back into it
Do your thing like it ain't nothing to it

Do your thing like it ain't nothing to it
Shake, sh-sh-shake that ass, girl!
[Verse 3]
You see me shining, lit up with diamonds
Cause I stay grindin', uh-huh
Homie, you can catch me swooping
Bentley coupin' switching lanes, haha
If you see me rolling, you know I'm holding
I'm bout my paper, yeah
Nigga, I'm serious, I ain't playing
I'll embed it in your brain, I'm off the chain, G-Unit
Next level now, turn it up a notch
Em and Dre sent me to tear up the spot
Front on me, oh no,
 
you know I'm loco
Hands up on the dance floor, okay, let's go

[Verse 1: Justin Vernon]
I can see you standing, honey
With his arms around your body
Laughin', but the joke's not funny at all
And it took you five whole minutes
To pack us up and leave me with it
Holdin' all this love out here in the hall
[Chorus: Justin Vernon]
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
[Post-Chorus: Justin Vernon]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
I can see you starin', honey
Like he's just your understudy
Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me
Second, third, and hundredth chances
Balancin' on breaking branches
Those eyes add insult to injury[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
I'm not your problem anymore
So who am I offending now?
You were my crown, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leaving out the side door
[Bridge: Justin Vernon, 
Taylor Swift
 & 
Both
]
So step right out, there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out (
You didn't even hear me out
)
You never gave a warning sign (
I gave so many signs
)
All this time
I never learned to read your mind (
Never learned to read my mind
)
I couldn't turn things around (
You never turned things around
)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (
I gave so many signs
)
So many signs, so many signs
You didn't even see the signs
[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Justin Vernon, 
Taylor Swift

I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out

So I'm leavin' out the side door[Outro: Justin Vernon &

Monks Lyrics
In “Monks,” Frank Ocean discusses the relationship he had with a female groupie he had met on a tour. He compares the audience at his tours to Buddhist monks and their spiritual idol, the Dalai Lama.
[Verse 1]
Mosh pits and bare chest
Stage divin' sky diver
Spray the crowd with cold water
Now it's mosh pits and wet tits
I think I need a cold shower
Cool waters
African girl speaks in English accent
Likes to fuck boys in bands
Likes to watch Westerns
And ride me without the hands
Show me her passport
She's on her own tour
[Chorus]
But you're beautiful to me, ooh
Wave 'em high, girl, to the sky
But you're beautiful to me, oh (Woah)
We're in the clouds
Wave 'em high, girl, to the sky
But you're beautiful to me, oh (Woah)
Life in the clouds
Keep em high, y'all
Beautiful stars in the sky
[Verse 2]
Monks in the mosh pit
Stage divin' Dalai Lama
Feet covered in cut flowers
They mosh for enlightenment
Clean chakra, good karma
Oh, one with the water
Indian girl sleeps above the temple
Plannin' a runaway, young at heart
You found a boyfriend
And now you wanna get away, get away
Just a virgin lover on a getaway, get away
And at sunset, they're gonna try and get away, get away
Abhayamudra[Bridge]
I never ask for much
But please keep up, lover
We've got no choices left
The runnin's fast
Run, run, run, run
You're beautiful to me
Run, run, run, run, you'd better run
You mean so much to me
In my world, my world
[Verse 3]
We made it safely
Even with your father's army trailin' us
We escaped him
Even with his archers' bows at our backs
What a great escape (Oh, wow)
But there's a long way still, in fact (Ooh)
We're lost in a jungle, underneath these clouds
There's a monsoon that never ends
A coke-white tiger woke us from our slumber
To guide and protect us 'til the end
[Chorus]
Woah, we're in the clouds
Wave 'em high now, to the sky
But you're beautiful to me, oh
Keep 'em high, y'all, show you right
But you're beautiful to me, oh
Right, beautiful",https://genius.com/Frank-ocean-monks-lyrics,"Frank discusses the relationship he had with a female groupie he had met on a tour. He continuously compares the audience at his tours to Buddhist monks and their spiritual idol (Dalai Lama).

“Monks” is, among other things, about Frank’s relationship with a series of women attending his concerts. He positions each concert as a religious experience. Worship is baked into the text of “Monks.” Frank is on a literal pedestal: the stage. The women of the track are inclined to see him as holier than, simply because he is an artist. And as Frank alludes (“African girl speaks in English accent / Likes to fuck boys in bands”), the women of the track are no strangers to this exchange of energy. Power imbalances aside, “Monks” rests on the power of lust. Frank is forthright about the sex: “Likes to watch Westerns / And ride me without the hands.” But it is within the subtext of “Monks” that we find our meaning. That is, we discover “Monks” is a warning on the perils of worship through the lens of lust.

For one, the mention of “Westerns” sets us up to understand the dynamic of groupie and artist and as an indictment of American ideals. Our society is responsible for propping Frank up on his pedestal simply because we see him on the stage. Capitalism has manufactured the cult of celebrity to sell us the narrative the talented are inherently better than us. True, Frank is using sex instead of sales, but in a nation where sex and money are linked in more ways than one, we’re not exactly stretching our reading. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Frank+Ocean/_/Monks"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

We Run This Town Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Seventeen, we owned those streets
Parking lot, that was our spot
That’s where we’d always meet
And we’d roll on out in a pickup truck parade
Stake our claim with a fire in a field in the middle of Nowhere, USA
We’d light the midnight up
[Chorus]
We'd drive too fast
We'd get too loud
We thought we made the world go ‘round
Nothin’ but a bunch of time to kill
Set up on the big hill
Make a toast, drink it down
Say, yeah man, we run this town
[Verse 2]
All the girls next door
They’d meet us out there
They couldn’t wait to get away
And come and let down their hair
We were rough around the edges
They were sweet as they could be
They were way too good
But they still let us steal a little kiss before they’d leave
Guess they thought we were cool because[Chorus]
We'd drive too fast
We'd get too loud
Yeah, we thought we made the world go ‘round
Drop it down in four-wheel
Set up on a big hill
And make a toast, drink it down
Say, yeah man, we run this town
[Bridge]
From crazy kids to dirt road kings
Oh, we didn’t know nothin'
But we knew everything
[Chorus]
We'd drive too fast
We'd get too loud
We thought we made the world go ‘round
Nothin’ but a bunch of time to kill
Set up on the big hill
Make a toast, drink it down
Say, yeah man, we run this town

Damn right, we run this town
Man, I love this town

Might as Well Get Stoned Lyrics

Well she said she didn't love me
And kicked me out the door
Now I'm livin' in one room
And sleepin' on the floor

And put some music on
And since I'm all alone

I might as well get stoned
And get it off my mind
Ain't got a thing to do
All I've got is time
The bottle's all I've had
To be a friend of mine
And since my whiskey's gone
I might as well get stoned

Every time I watch the TV
Another soldier dies
Another brother's gone
Another mother cries[Pre-Chorus 2]
Now I know they've got a job to do
But if I had one wish
I wish they'd all come home
So we could all get stoned
[Chorus 2]
I might as well get stoned
And get it off my mind
Ain't got shit to do
All I've got is time
The bottle's all I've had
To be a friend of mine
And since my whiskey's gone

This is the third track off of the AC/DC album Back In Black, which tells the story of the singer trying to find out how this mysterious, fine woman makes her money.

Never gonna give it for free
Your apartment with a view, on the finest avenue
Lookin' at your beat on the street
You're always pushin', shovin', satisfied with nothin'
You bitch, you must be gettin' old
[Pre-Chorus]
So, stop your love on the road, all your diggin' for gold
You make me wonder
Yes, I wonder, I wonder

Honey
What do you do for money?
Honey
What do you do for money? Oh, where do you get your kicks?

You're lovin' on the take and you're always on the make
Squeezin' all the blood outta men
Yeah, we're standin' in a queue just to spend the night with you
It's business as usual again
You're always grabbin', stabbin', tryin' get it back in
But girl, you must be gettin' slow[Pre-Chorus]
So, stop your love on the road, all your diggin' for gold
You make me wonder
Yes, I wonder
Yes, I wonder

[Verse 1]
Make sure nobody sees you leave
Hood over your head, keep your eyes down
Tell your friends you're out for a run
You’ll be flushed when you return
Take the road less traveled by
Tell yourself you can always stop
What started in beautiful rooms
Ends with meetings in parking lots
[Chorus]
And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and longing stares
It's born from just one single glance
But it dies and it dies and it dies
A million little times
[Verse 2]
Leave the perfume on the shelf
That you picked out just for him
So you leave no trace behind
Like you don’t even exist
Take the words for what they are
A dwindling, mercurial high
A drug that only worked
The first few hundred times[Chorus]
And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and stolen stares
They show their truth one single time
But they lie and they lie and they lie
A million little times
[Bridge]
And you wanna scream
Don't call me ""kid,"" don't call me ""baby""
Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me
You showed me colors you know I can't see with anyone else
Don't call me ""kid,"" don't call me ""baby""
Look at this idiotic fool that you made me
You taught me a secret language I can't speak with anyone else
[Outro]
And you know damn well
For you, I would ruin myself

[Verse 1]
Loving you, I thought I couldn't get no higher
Your November rain could set the night on fire, night on fire
But we could only burn so long
Counterfeit emotions only run skin deep
Know you're lyin' when you're lyin' next to me, next to me
How did we get so far gone?
[Pre-Chorus]
I should know by now
You should know by now
We should know by now
[Chorus]
Something's gotta give, something's gotta break
But all I do is give, and all you do is take
Something's gotta change, but I know that it won't
No reason to stay is a good reason to go
Is a good reason to go, ooh
[Verse 2]
I have never heard a silence quite so loud
I walk in the room and you don't make a sound, make a sound
You're good at makin' me feel small
If it doesn't hurt me, why do I still cry?
If it didn't kill me, then I'm half alive, half alive
How did we get so far gone?[Pre-Chorus]

And my patience is now setting like the sun
When my tears fall on your lap, we've just begun
And by now, I know the damage has been done
That I wanted, baby, that I wanted

Is it hauntin', baby, that I'm wantin'

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Set the cheetahs on the loose
Oh, oh, oh, oh
There's a thief out on the move
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Underneath our legion's view
Oh, oh, oh, oh
They have taken Cleopatra
[Bridge]
Run, run, run, come back for my glory (Cleopatra, Cleopatra)
Bring her back to me (Cleopatra, Cle-o-patra, Cleopatra)
Run, run, run, the crown of our pharaoh (Cleopatra, Cleopatra)
The throne of our queen is empty (Cle-o-patra, Cleopatra)
[Verse 1]
We'll run to the future, shining like diamonds
In a rocky world, rocky-ky world
Our skin like bronze and our hair like cashmere
As we march to the rhythm on the palace floor, ah-ooh
Chandeliers inside the pyramids tremble from the force
Cymbals crash inside the pyramids, voices fill up the halls[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, ooh
Set the cheetahs on the loose
Aye, ah, aye
There's a thief out on the move
Oh, oh, oh, ooh
Underneath our legion's view
Aye, ah, aye
They have taken Cleopatra, Cleopatra
[Verse 2]
The jewel of Africa, jewel
What good is a jewel that ain't still precious?
How could you run off on me? How could you run off on us?
You feel like God inside that gold
I found you laying down with Samson and his full head of hair
I found my black queen, Cleopatra, bad dreams, Cleopatra
[Outro]
Oh, oh, woah
Remove her, send the cheetahs to the tomb
Oh, oh, woah
Our war is over, our queen has met her doom
Oh, no more
She lives no more, a serpent's in her room
Oh, no more
He has killed Cleopatra, Cleopatra[Part II]
[Segue]
Big sun coming strong through the motel blinds
Wake up to your girl
For now, let's call her Cleopatra, Cleopatra
I'll watch you fix your hair
Then put your panties on in the mirror, Cleopatra
Then your lipstick, Cleopatra
Then your six-inch heels, catch her
She's headed to the pyramid
[Refrain]
She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid, ayy
Working at the pyramid tonight, oh yeah
Working at the pyramid, oh-ah
Working at the pyramid tonight, yeah
Working at the pyramid, oh
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
[Verse 1]
Pimpin' in my convos
Bubbles in my champagne, let it be some jazz playing
Top floor motel suite,
 
twisting my cigars
Floor model TV with the VCR
Got rubies in my damn chain
Whip ain't got no gas tank, but it still got woodgrain
Got your girl working for me
Hit the strip and my bill's paid, that keep my bills paid
Hit the strip and my bill's paid, keep a nigga bills paid[Refrain]
She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid, ayy
Working at the pyramid tonight, ayy
Working at the pyramid, oh-ah
Working at the pyramid tonight, yeah
Working at the pyramid, ooh
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
[Verse 2]
You showed up after work, I'm bathing your body
Touch you in places only I know
You're wet and you're warm just like our bathwater
Can we make love before you go?
The way you say my name makes me feel like I'm that nigga
But I'm still unemployed
You could say it's big, but you take it
Ride cowgirl
But your love ain't free no more, baby
But your love ain't free no more

Working at the pyramid, ayy
Working at the pyramid tonight, oh yeah
Working at the pyramid, that's right

She is no longer revered but used and abused by men who would have died to protect her honor many centuries ago.

The song makes reference to the historical Cleopatra, who brought dishonor to her country by becoming Mark Antony’s mistress. Mark Antony was a conqueror who wanted Egypt as Roman territory, which is how they crossed paths.

In Ocean’s song, he narrates a similar happening with him and his woman. Now that she became a traitor and left him for the enemy, her decision has backfired on her—because she is not an entity of glory and honor anymore, but of dishonor. She is reduced to a common stripper who is now taking care of her man who has no job. It’s almost as if “the king” is paying her back for what she did, because the narrator speaks of his woman stripping to “keep a nigga bills paid.”

But there is still some kind of unhealthy love and devotion to one another because they still stay together, and are a couple so to speak. This song is literally a historical account of the Black man and woman in America and our slow fall from grace. From Gods to dogs, symbolically. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Frank+Ocean/_/Pyramids"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Maybe I stare too much, maybe not long enough
Funny how I forget to blink
But when you let down your hair, dancin' like no one's there
I know I'm where I'm supposed to be
[Pre-Chorus]
Say, ""I love you"" under my breath
More times than you can digest
Music every time I hear your name, oh
Your head's layin' right on my chest
Sun's up and I still ain't got no rest
[Chorus]
Don't wanna close my eyes, I'm scared I'll miss too much
Don't wanna fall asleep, I'd rather fall in love
When I can't feel you, I feel out of touch
Two seconds without you's like two months
Don't wanna close my eyes, I'm scared I'll miss too much
Don't wanna fall asleep, I'd rather fall in love
'Cause eternity with you ain't long enough
Two seconds without you's like two months and that's too much[Verse 2]
Love the way you love your mom and take on all your friends' problems
Still somehow stop the world for us, oh
I still relive that second, I met my biggest blessin'
Prayed for you, look what God has done
[Pre-Chorus]
Say, ""I love you"" under my breath
More times than you can digest
Music every time I hear your name, oh
Your head's layin' right on my chest
Sun's up and I still ain't got no rest
[Chorus]
Don't wanna close my eyes, I'm scared I'll miss too much
Don't wanna fall asleep, I'd rather fall in love
When I can't feel you, I feel out of touch
Two seconds without you's like two months
Don't wanna close my eyes, I'm scared I'll miss too much
Don't wanna fall asleep, I'd rather fall in love

Just Over Lyrics
[Verse 1]
She called and said she wanted to see me
I say, ""Yeah, that's fine, baby, drop on by""
I figured I could make it better
Just like every other time we had this fight
Of all the kind of over it could've been
I never would've bet on this
[Chorus]
I was thinking she would come over, stay over
Wake up hungover, still head over heels for me
Thought it was something we could talk over, drink over
Then it would be over, back to how it used to be
No, but it's the kind where the sheets get colder
And she don't need no shoulder to cry on, she's gone
She ain't pulling over, it's just over
[Verse 2]
When she left the kitchen, she left no questions
I said where in the world did I go wrong?
And it don't matter where she's headed
She's gone, gone, gone
[Chorus]
I was thinking she would come over, stay over
Wake up hungover, still head over heels for me
Thought it was something we could talk over, drink over
Then it would be over, back to how it used to be
No, but it's the kind where the sheets get colder
And she don't need no shoulder to cry on, she's gone
She ain't pulling over, it's just over[Bridge]
Like the page, she's turning over
Like the light, she's starting over
Without me
[Chorus]
I was thinking she would come over, stay over
Wake up hungover, still head over heels for me
Thought it was something we could talk over, drink over
Then it would be over, back to how it used to be
No, but it's the kind where the sheets get colder
And she don't need no shoulder to cry on, she's gone
She ain't pulling over, it's just over

Yeah, it's just over

Your light is inside of me
Like a raging roar
Like an ocean born
You're in my veins
Your voice is serenity when the sun goes down
And the strength I've found is in my veins
[Pre-Chorus]
Our story binds us like right and wrong
Your hand in mine
Marching to the beat of the storm

And our love is gonna conquer it all
We are lionhearts

When the darkness rules
You're the brightest moon

If I catch you talking to that boy again

I never thought that I would find a way out
I never thought I'd hear my heart beat so loud
I can't believe there's something left in my chest anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again
I used to think that I was made out of stone
I used to spend so many nights on my own
I never knew I had it in me to dance anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again
[Pre-Chorus]
Show me that heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn, you got me in love again

You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again

So many nights, my tears fell harder than rain
Scared I would take my broken heart to the grave
I'd rather die than have to live in a storm like before

Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy

[Intro: Dr. Dre]
K-Dot, pick up the phone, nigga
Every time I call, it's going to voicemail
Don't tell me they got you on some weirdo rap shit, nigga
No socks and skinny jeans and shit, ha
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-haha
Call me on Shaniqua's phone!
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo-boo
Your home boy, your block that you're from, boo-boo
Lil' hoes you went to school with, boo-boo
Baby mama and your new bitch, boo-boo
We was in the hood, fourteen with the deuce-deuce
Fourteen years later, going hard like we used to
On the dead homies
On the dead homies
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I don't give a fuck about no politics in rap, my nigga
Our lil' homie Stunna Deuce ain't never comin' back, my nigga
So you better go hard every time you jump on wax, my nigga
Fuck what they talkin' 'bout, your shit is where it's at, my nigga
Came in this game, you stuck your fangs in this game
You wore no chain in this game, your hood, your name in this game
Now you double up, time to bubble up the bread and huddle up
Stickin' to the scripts, now, here, if them Benjamins go cuddle up
Skip, hop, drip, drop
Flip, flop with the white tube sock
It goes, 
""Sherm sticks, burn this""
That's what the product smell like when the chemicals mix
50-nigga salute, out the Compton zoo, with the extras
El Co's, Monte Carlos, Road Kings, and dressers
Rip Ridaz, P-Funkers, Mexicans, they fuck with you
Asians, they fuck with you, nobody can fuck with you[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo-boo
Your homeboy, your block that you're from, boo-boo
Lil' hoes you went to school with, boo-boo
Baby mama and your new bitch, boo-boo
We was in the hood, fourteen with the deuce-deuce
Fourteen years later, going hard like we used to
On the dead homies
On the dead homies
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Hopped out the Caddy, just got my dick sucked
The little homies called and said, ""The enemies done cliqued up""
Oh, yeah? Puto want to squabble with mi barrio?
Oh, yeah? Tell 'em they can run it for the cardio
Oh, yeah? Everything is everything, it's scandalous
Slow motion for the ambulance, the project filled with cameras
The LAPD gamblin', scramblin', football numbers slanderin'
Niggas' names on paper—you snitched all summer
Streets don't fail me now
They tell me it's a new gang in town
From Compton to Congress
Set-trippin' all around
Ain't nothin' new but a flu of new Demo-Crips and Re-Blood-icans
Red state versus a blue state—which one you governin'?
They give us guns and drugs, call us thugs,
 
make it they promise to fuck with you
No condom, they fuck with you,
 
Obama say, ""What it do?""[Interlude: Kendrick Lamar]
Obama say, ""What it do?""
Obama say, ""What it do?""
Obama say, ""What it do?""
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo-boo
Your homeboy, your block that you're from, boo-boo

Baby mama and your new bitch, boo-boo
We was in the hood, fourteen with the deuce-deuce
Fourteen years later, going hard like we used to
On the dead homies
On the dead homies
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Everybody want to talk about who this and who that
Who the realest and who wack, or who white or who black
Critics want to mention that they miss when hip-hop was rappin'
Motherfucker, if you did, then Killer Mike'd be platinum
Y'all priorities fucked up, put energy in wrong shit
Hennessy and Crown Vic, my memory been gone since
Don't ask about no camera blocking at award shows
No, don't ask about my bitch, no, don't ask about my Vogues
'Less you askin' me about power, yeah, I got a lot of it
I'm the only nigga next to Snoop that can push the button
Had the Coast on standby
""K. Dot, what up? I heard they opened up Pandora's box""
I box 'em all in, by a landslide
Nah, homie, we too sensitive, it spill out to the streets
I make the call and get the Coast involved, then history repeats
But I resolved inside that private hall while sitting down with Jay
He said, ""It's funny how one verse can fuck up the game""[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo-boo
[Poem: Kendrick Lamar]
I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in a hotel room
I didn't want to self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
But that didn't stop survivor's guilt
Going back and forth
Trying to convince myself the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting a continuous war
Back in the city
I was entering a new one",https://genius.com/Kendrick-lamar-hood-politics-lyrics,"""Hood Politics"" contains a sample of ""All for Myself"", written and performed by Sufjan Stevens.

[Verse 1]
Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
[Chorus]
But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I
[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite
[Verse 2]
A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing[Chorus]
But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends, I
I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I
[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite
[Bridge]
To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'
[Chorus]
'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
I knew you
Leavin' like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing[Verse 3]
But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back

The song's lyrics discuss a romance lost in memories, from the perspective of a female narrator named Betty, one of the several fictitious characters narrated in Folklore. An accompanying music video for the song, written, directed, and styled by Swift, was released alongside the album launch. The video has been described as following a cottagecore aesthetic, featuring Swift in three different settings: a ""cozy cabin"" in the woods, a moss-covered forest, and a dark stormy sea, which represents the concept of the different phases in relationships. ""Cardigan"" was praised by music critics for its poetic songwriting and laid-back sound. It received nominations for Song of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards. An acoustic version of the song, branded as ""Cabin in Candlelight"", was also released.

Commercially, ""Cardigan"" debuted atop the global Spotify songs chart with over 7.742 million streams, which was, at that time, the biggest opening day for a song on the platform in 2020. With the song's debut at the number-one spot of the Billboard Hot 100 as well, Swift scored the sixth U.S. number-one single of her career. Along with Folklore's debut atop the Billboard 200 the same week, she became the first artist ever to simultaneously debut atop the Hot 100 and Billboard 200. ""Cardigan"" further topped the Hot Alternative Songs, Hot Rock & Alternative Songs, Streaming Songs and Digital Song Sales charts, making Swift the first act in history to garner twenty chart-toppers on the latter. It reached number one in Australia, the top ten in Canada, Ireland, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and the United Kingdom, and the top 20 in Denmark, Estonia, Lithuania and Scotland. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Swift/_/carDIGan"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I know that all this shit's fabricated, mmm
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time
[Chorus]
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin'
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin', mmm-mmm
[Verse 2]
Sometimes, it's hard to find
Find my way up into the clouds
Tune it out, they can be so loud
You remind me of a time
When things weren't so complicated
All I need is to see your face[Pre-Chorus]
Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I know that all this shit's fabricated, mmm
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time

[Intro]
Oh, yeah
[Verse 1]
Don't need permission
Made my decision to test my limits
'Cause it's my business, God as my witness
Start what I finished
Don't need no hold up
Taking control of this kind of moment
I'm locked and loaded
Completely focused, my mind is open
[Pre-Chorus]
All that you got
Skin to skin, oh my God
Don't you stop, boy
[Chorus]
Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout
[Verse 2]
Nothing to prove and I'm bulletproof and
Know what I'm doing
The way we're movin'
Like introducing us to a new thing
I wanna savor, save it for later
The taste, the flavor, 'cause I'm a taker, 'cause I'm a giver
It's only nature, I live for danger[Pre-Chorus]
All that you got
Skin to skin, oh my God
Don't ya stop, boy (Oh, yeah)
[Chorus]
Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
[Post-Chorus]
All girls wanna be like that
Bad girls underneath, like that
You know how I'm feeling inside
(Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout—)
All girls wanna be like that
Bad girls underneath, like that
You know how I'm feeling inside

All girls wanna be like that (Mm-mm)
Bad girls underneath like that
You know how I'm feeling inside (You know how I'm feeling inside, baby)

Bad girls underneath like that
You know how I'm feeling inside

[Verse 1]
It was fun playin' with knives
Until a blade stuck in the left side of my chest
Surprise
I'm not down again
I turned the page
The story's mine
No more watchin' the world from my doorstep passin' me by
(
Passin' me by
)
[Pre-Chorus]
And I’ll just keep changin' these colors, colors, colors, colors
I'm not in the same place that I was, I was, I was, I was
[Chorus]
But if somebody tells me I'll go back to my old ways
I'm gonna say ""no way""
I'm out of the doorway
I'm hearin' them all say I'll go back to my old ways
Not goin' back to my old ways
[Post-Chorus]
Not goin' back to my old ways
(
Not goin' back to my old ways
)
[Verse 2]
Now I know what's good for me
All that I need
And I can't wait to sink my teeth in and take another bite
And the best part about it is I'm the only one who can do somethin' about it
I fill the well with some water, it's overflowin'
Black into gold
Who knew it'd be so bright without the blindfolds?[Pre-Chorus]
And I’ll just keep changin' these colors, colors, colors, colors
I'm not in the same place that I was, I was, I was, I was
[Chorus]
But if somebody tells me I'll go back to my old ways
I'm gonna say ""no way""
I'm out of the doorway
I'm hearin' them all say I'll go back to my old ways
Not goin' back to my old ways
[Post-Chorus]
Not goin' back to my old ways
(
Not goin' back to my old ways
)
[Bridge]
Every scar
The flames burnt them all
I'm not afraid to fall
I'm spiralin’, I'm spiralin’
I pass the stars
I'm not burning out
I'm not afraid to fall
I'm not afraid anymore
[Breakdown]
And I just keep changin' my colors
I'm not in the same place that I was, I was
(And the best part about it is I'm the only who can do somethin' about it
I fill the well with some water, it's overflowin')
Black into gold
Who knew it'd be so bright without the blindfolds?[Pre-Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I used to think, one day, we'd tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
And people would say, ""They're the lucky ones""
I used to know my place was the spot next to you
Now, I'm searching the room for an empty seat
'Cause lately, I don't even know what page you're on
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fallout
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up, I can't break through
[Chorus]
Now, I'm standin' alone in a crowded room
And we're not speakin'
And I'm dyin' to know
Is it killin' you like it's killin' me? Yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
[Post-Chorus]
Next chapter[Verse 2]
How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
And you're doin' your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think, one day, I'll tell the story of us
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should've held me
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm scared to see the ending
Why are we pretending this is nothin'?
I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite this loud
[Chorus]
Now, I'm standin' alone in a crowded room
And we're not speakin'
And I'm dyin' to know
Is it killin' you like it's killin' me? Yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
[Bridge]
This is lookin' like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If you said you'd rather love than fight[Pre-Chorus]
So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon
[Chorus]
Now, I'm standin' alone in a crowded room
And we're not speakin'
And I'm dyin' to know
Is it killin' you like it's killin' me? Yeah
And I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now
And we're not speakin'
And I'm dyin' to know
Is it killin' you like it's killin' me? Yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
'Cause we're going down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

[Verse 1]
Long were the nights when
My days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor won't fall through again
And my mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue sky
Then go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules everyday
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone tonight
Well, I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why
[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I should've known
[Verse 2]
Well, maybe it's me
And my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love and take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
Who don't understand
And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said
""Run as fast as you can""[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong
Don't you think nineteen's too young
To be played by your dark, twisted games when I loved you so?
I should've known
[Bridge]
You are an expert at sorry and keeping lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks over your sad empty town
Oh, oh
[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress wrote you a song
You should've known[Outro]

Ah-ha man
Ay you know where them niggas be at right?
**Gun cocks sound effect**
Take me to 'em

All through the hood I keep hearin' niggas sayin' (Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap)
I'm supposed to die tonight
Niggas done put a hit out and they talkin' like this shit okay (Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap)
I'm gonna ride tonight
We rollin', whip stolen, AK loaded
I'm gonna ride tonight
We smokin' (Uh-huh), straight loc'n, lockin' loadin'
Somebody gon' die tonight
[Verse 1]
This is nuttin' new, I been in this position before
Grandma crib, niggas outside of her door
Different day, same shit,
 
old MAC, new clip
32 hollow-tips, gloves, no rubber grip
I'm a boss, but niggas never show no respect
I catch 'em slippin', I'll have 'em tongue-kissin' my TEC
Wan come, test me, pussy boy, don't try
Police response never fast enough to shots fired
Don't be stupid, find out who you fuckin' with son
'Fore we find out where yo bitch get her hair and nails done
It's elementary
Life is but a dream, you know row, row your boat
Ya blood forms a stream
After you get hit, you shoulda thought about the shit
You took that paper you take a life or yo life get took bitch
Sometimes I sit and look at life from a different angle
Don't know if I'm God's child or I'm Satan's angel[Chorus]
All through the hood I keep hearin' niggas sayin' (Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap)
I'm supposed to die tonight
Niggas done put a hit out and they talkin' like this shit okay (Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap)

We rollin', whip stolen, AK loaded
I'm gonna ride tonight
We smokin', straight loc'n, lockin' loadin'
Somebody gon' die tonight
[Verse 2]
In 2002, if you asked me to make a wish
I simply woulda wished that my music would be a hit
Big said, ""Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
And pray for my downfall,"" I understand it all
But me, I'm a little more flashy a nigga
So chances are, I'ma have to blast me a nigga
I'm on that Kevlar vest shit, that Wild Wild West shit
There's 81 one karat stones in my necklace
I shine so hard, I make motherfuckers wan' kill me
Every projects in every hood I go, they feel me
Know it sounds like rap, but this shit is real B
I don't talk that rich shit, but nigga I'm filthy
When I come out to play, and my mob ain't with me
You can bet your bottom dollar that revolver with me
Homeboy, frontin' on me'll shorten your lifespan
Hold the mic with my left, my knife in my right hand
Yeah![Chorus]
All through the hood I keep hearin' niggas sayin' (Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap)

Reasons why you ran don't make you a good man
Yes, I understand
You were on time at the wrong time
I was debating, but tried and I don't know why
You can act cold on a dime and so outta line

For you
I’d do anything for you

Champion, champion)

The ""place"" in question was ""the mind"", making its subject matter slightly more cerebral than Britain's kissing and cuddling songs and America's surf music from that period. Lennon is quoted as saying: ""'There's a Place' was my attempt at a sort of Motown, black thing."" It says the usual Lennon things: 'In my mind there's no sorrow...' It's all in your mind.""

Composed at McCartney's Forthlin Road home, it was part of the group's stage repertoire in 1963. With its major seventh harmonica intro (later reprised) and searing two-part vocal harmonies in fifths (Lennon low, McCartney high), it stands out as an early Beatles milestone track. The song was recorded on 11 February 1963 in ten takes during the first of three sessions for Please Please Me.

The song was officially credited to ""McCartney/Lennon"", as were all other Lennon/McCartney compositions on the original UK release of Please Please Me. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/There%27s+a+Place"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

[Intro]
Mm
[Verse 1]
I fall asleep cryin'
You turn up the TV
You don't wanna hear me
One more sleepless night
Big day in the morning
So, I take my time to self-soothe
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm too much for you
So I really gotta do
The thing I don't wanna do
No, I don't, don't, don't, don't
[Chorus]
I don't wanna fuck with your head
It's breakin' my heart
To keep breakin' yours again (Yours again, yours again, yours again)
This situationship has to end
But I just can't refuse
I don't wanna break up again (Up again, up again, up again), baby
[Verse 2]
I made it so easy
Spent so much on therapy
Blamed my own codependency
But you didn't even try
When you finally did, it was at the wrong time
Won't abandon me again for you and I, I[Pre-Chorus]
I'm too much for you
So I really gotta do
The thing I don't wanna do
No, I don't, don't, don't, don't
[Chorus]
I don't wanna fuck with your head
It's breakin' my heart (Breakin' my heart)
To keep breakin' yours again (Yours again, yours again, yours again)
This situationship has to end
But I just can't refuse
I don't wanna break up again (Up again, up again, up again)
[Bridge]
We both know it's time
So we say goodbye
Just one kiss goodbye
With tears in our eyes
Hope you won't, won't regret me
Hope you'll still think fondly of our little life
[Chorus]
I don't wanna fuck with your head
It's breakin' my heart (Breakin' my heart)
To keep breakin' yours again (Yours again, yours again, yours again)
This situationship has to end
But I just can't refuse
I don't wanna break up again (Up again, up again, up again), baby[Outro]
(Hah, hah, hah)
(Hah, hah, hah)
Don't wanna break up again (Breakin' my heart)
I don't wanna, baby
Situationship has to end (Know it has to end)
Just can't refuse

Tell me not to waste my time

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
I read the news today, oh, boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords
I saw a film today, oh, boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
[Refrain: John Lennon]
I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up, I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream
Ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah[Verse 2: John Lennon]
I read the news today, oh, boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. 

Background

John Lennon wrote the melody and most of the lyrics to the verses of ""A Day in the Life"" in mid-January 1967. Soon afterwards, he presented the song to Paul McCartney, who contributed a middle-eight section. According to Lennon, McCartney also contributed the pivotal line ""I'd love to turn you on. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/A+Day+in+the+Life"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","""A Day in the Life"" is a song written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney (credited to Lennon/McCartney) and recorded by The Beatles for their 1967 album  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. 

Background

John Lennon wrote the melody and most of the lyrics to the verses of ""A Day in the Life"" in mid-January 1967. Soon afterwards, he presented the song to Paul McCartney, who contributed a middle-eight section. According to Lennon, McCartney also contributed the pivotal line ""I'd love to turn you on."" In a 1970 interview, Lennon discussed their collaboration on the song:

Paul and I were definitely working together, especially on ""A Day in the Life"" ... The way we wrote a lot of the time: you'd write the good bit, the part that was easy, like ""I read the news today"" or whatever it was, then when you got stuck or whenever it got hard, instead of carrying on, you just drop it; then we would meet each other, and I would sing half, and he would be inspired to write the next bit and vice versa. He was a bit shy about it because I think he thought it's already a good song ... So we were doing it in his room with the piano. He said ""Should we do this?"" ""Yeah, let's do that.""

The song is an example of the mutual inspiration that often occurred within the Lennon-McCartney partnership. As stated by Lennon in 1968, ""It was a good piece of work between Paul and me. I had the 'I read the news today' bit, and it turned Paul on, because now and then we really turn each other on with a bit of song, and he just said 'yeah' – bang bang, like that.""

Lyrics
Tara Browne
According to Lennon, the inspiration for the first two verses was the death of Tara Browne, the 21-year-old heir to the Guinness fortune who had crashed his car on 18 December 1966. Browne was a friend of Lennon and McCartney, and had instigated McCartney's first experience with LSD. Lennon adapted the song's verse lyrics from a story in the 17 January 1967 edition of the Daily Mail, which reported the ruling on a custody action over Browne's two young children.

""4,000 holes""
Lennon wrote the song's final verse inspired by a Far & Near news brief, in the same 17 January edition of the Daily Mail that had inspired the first two verses. Under the headline ""The holes in our roads"", the brief stated: ""There are 4,000 holes in the road in Blackburn, Lancashire, or one twenty-sixth of a hole per person, according to a council survey. If Blackburn is typical, there are two million holes in Britain's roads and 300,000 in London."" Lennon had a problem with the words of the final verse, however, not being able to think of how to connect ""Now they know how many holes it takes to"" and ""the Albert Hall"". His friend Terry Doran suggested that the holes would ""fill"" the Albert Hall, and the lyric was eventually used.

Drug Culture
McCartney said about the line ""I'd love to turn you on"", which concludes both verse sections: ""This was the time of Tim Leary's 'Turn on, tune in, drop out' and we wrote, 'I'd love to turn you on.' John and I gave each other a knowing look: 'Uh-huh, it's a drug song. You know that, don't you?'"" George Martin, the Beatles' producer, commented that he had always suspected that the line ""found my way upstairs and had a smoke"" was a drug reference, recalling how the Beatles would ""disappear and have a little puff"", presumably of marijuana, but not in front of him. ""When [Martin] was doing his TV programme on Pepper"", McCartney recalled later, ""he asked me, 'Do you know what caused Pepper?' I said, 'In one word, George, drugs. Pot.' And George said, 'No, no. But you weren't on it all the time.' 'Yes, we were.' Sgt. Pepper was a drug album.""

BBC radio ban

The song became controversial for its supposed references to drugs. On 20 May 1967, during the BBC Light Programme's preview of the Sgt. Pepper album, disc jockey Kenny Everett was prevented from playing ""A Day in the Life"". The BBC announced that it would not broadcast the song due to the line ""I'd love to turn you on"", which, according to the corporation, advocated drug use. Other lyrics allegedly referring to drugs include ""found my way upstairs and had a smoke / somebody spoke and I went into a dream"". A spokesman for the BBC stated: ""We have listened to this song over and over again. And we have decided that it appears to go just a little too far, and could encourage a permissive attitude to drug-taking.""

At the time, Lennon and McCartney denied that there were drug references in ""A Day in the Life"" and publicly complained about the ban at a dinner party at the home of their manager, Brian Epstein, celebrating their album's release. Lennon said that the song was simply about ""a crash and its victim"", and called the line in question ""the most innocent of phrases"". McCartney later said: ""This was the only one in the album written as a deliberate provocation. A stick-that-in-your-pipe ... But what we want is to turn you on to the truth rather than pot."" The Beatles nevertheless aligned themselves with the drug culture in Britain by paying for (at McCartney's instigation) a full-page advertisement in The Times, in which, along with 60 other signatories, they and Epstein denounced the law against marijuana as ""immoral in principle and unworkable in practice"". In addition, on 19 June, McCartney confirmed to an ITN reporter, further to his statement in a recent Life magazine interview, that he had taken LSD. Described by MacDonald as a ""careless admission"", it led to condemnation of McCartney in the British press, recalling the outcry caused by the publication of Lennon's ""More popular than Jesus"" remark in the US in 1966. The BBC ban on the song was eventually lifted on 13 March 1972. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/A+Day+in+the+Life"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

eternal sunshine Lyrics
[Intro]
I
[Verse 1]
I don't care what people say
We both know I couldn't change you
I guess you could say the same
Can't rearrange truth
I've never seen someone lie like you do
So much, even you start to think it's true
Ooh
Get me out of this loop, yeah, yeah

Rather feel painless

What we could've fought through behind this door, mm
So I close it and move, yeah, yeah

Ain't nobody prayin' for me
(Ain't nobody prayin' for me)

Ain't nobody prayin' for me
(
Nobody prayin' for me

Ain't nobody
 prayin' for me

Prayin' for me

(
Nobody prayin' for me

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I feel like a chip on my shoulders
I feel like I'm losin' my focus
I feel like I'm losin' my patience
I feel like my thoughts in the basement
Feel like, I feel like you're miseducated
Feel like I don't wanna be bothered
I feel like you may be the problem
I feel like it ain't no tomorrow, fuck the world
The world is endin', I'm done pretendin'
And fuck you if you get offended
I feel like friends been overrated
I feel like the family been fakin'
I feel like the feelings are changin'
Feel like my thought of compromise is jaded
Feel like you wanna scrutinize how I made it
Feel like I ain't feelin' you all
Feel like removin' myself, no feelings involved
I feel for you, I've been in the field for you
It's real for you, right? Shit, I feel like—[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin'

I feel niggas been out of pocket
I feel niggas tappin' they pockets
I feel like debatin' on who the greatest can stop it
I am legend, I feel like all of y'all is peasants
I feel like all of y'all is desperate
I feel like all it take is a second to feel like
Mike Jordan whenever holdin' a real mic
I ain't feelin' your presence
Feel like I'ma learn you a lesson
Feel like only me and the music though
I feel like your feelin' ain't mutual
I feel like the enemy you should know
Feel like the feelin' of no hope
The feelin' of bad dope
A quarter ounce manipulated from soap
The feelin', the feelin' of false freedom
I'll force-feed 'em the poison that fill 'em up in the prison
I feel like it's just me
Look, I feel like I can't breathe
Look, I feel like I can't sleep
Look, I feel heartless, often off this
Feelin' of fallin', of fallin' apart with
Darkest hours, lost it
Fillin' the void of bein' employed with ballin'
Streets is talkin', fill in the blanks with coffins
Fill up the banks with dollars
Fill up the graves with fathers
Fill up the babies with bullshit
Internet blogs and pulpit, fill 'em with gossip
I feel like this gotta be the feelin' where 'Pac was
The feelin' of an apocalypse happenin'
But nothin' is awkward, the feelin' won't prosper
The feelin' is toxic, I feel like I'm boxin' demons
Monsters, false prophets schemin'
Sponsors, industry promises
Niggas, bitches, honkies, crackers, Compton
Church, religion, token blacks in bondage
Lawsuit visits, subpoena served in concert
Fuck your feelings, I mean this for imposters
I can feel it, the phoenix sure to watch us
I can feel it, the dream is more than process
I can put a regime that forms a Loch Ness
I can feel it, the scream that haunts all logic
I feel like sayin' somethin', I feel like takin' somethin'
I feel like skatin' off, I feel like waitin' for 'em
Maybe it's too late for 'em

Can you make it feel like home if I tell you you're mine?

I’m Happy Just to Dance with You Lyrics
Although this song was a Lennon-McCartney composition, George Harrison takes lead vocals. Like “Do You Want To Know A Secret”, it reflects Harrison’s (ill-fitting) status as “the quiet Beatle” – he is content…

[Intro]
Before this dance is through, I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you dance with me
[Verse 1]
I don't want to kiss or hold your hand
If it's funny, try and understand
There is really nothing else I'd rather do
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you

I don't need to hug or hold you tight
I just want to dance with you all night
In this world, there's nothing I would rather do

Just to dance with you (Oh, oh)
Is everything I need (Oh, oh)

I'm so happy when you dance with me

Let's pretend we just can't see his face

ordinary things Lyrics
[Intro: Ariana Grande]
Hmm
[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
We could go pop all the champagne in California
We could have omakase in Tokyo if you wanna
Hypothetically, we (We) could do (Do)
Anything that we like
We could hit up all the slopes in matching snowsuits
We could hang out at the Louvre all night if you want to
We could spend every dime
But I don't want (Want) anything ('Thing)
But more time
[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
No matter what we do
There's never gonna be an ordinary thing
No ordinary things with you
It's funny, but it's true
There's never gonna be an ordinary thing
As long as I'm with you
[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
You hit just like the first sip of wine after a long day
You hit like my biggеst fan when I hear what the critiquеs say
You hit just like a green light when I'm stuck runnin' real late
I don't need no diamonds, just your time[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
No matter what we do
There's never gonna be an ordinary thing
No ordinary things with you
It's funny, but it's true
There's never gonna be an ordinary thing
As long as I'm with you
[Bridge: Ariana Grande]
Ordinary thing, ordinary things with you
Ordinary thing, as long as I'm with you
[Outro: Marjorie Grande]
And when he'd come home, and I'd see him (
Is it difficult?
)
When he first gets off that train
It was like God Almighty arrived
It was like seein' daylight
I mean, I could've packed up and left a million times
You know? It's not that we never fought
You can overcome that
You know? It-it's very easy
And as I told her, never go to bed without kissin' goodnight
That's the worst thing to do, don't ever, ever do that
And if you can't, and if you don't feel comfortable doing it
You're in the wrong place, get out",https://genius.com/Ariana-grande-ordinary-things-lyrics,"",""

I didn't think you'd understand me
How could you ever even try?
I don't wanna tiptoe, but I don't wanna hide
But I don't wanna feed this monstrous fire
Just wanna let this story die
And I'll be alright

Not what you made me

And maybe that's all I need

However, she admits that it hurts when society dehumanizes artists. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Lady+Gaga/_/Plastic+Doll"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

[Verse 1: Harry]
If I could fly
I'd be coming right back home to you
I think I might
Give up everything, just ask me to
[Pre-Chorus: Liam]
Pay attention, I hope that you listen
'Cause I let my guard down
Right now, I'm completely defenceless

For your eyes only, I show you my heart
For when you're lonely and forget who you are
I'm missing half of me when we're apart
Now you know me, for your eyes only
For your eyes only

I've got scars
Even though they can't always be seen
And pain gets hard

Throw a steak off the ark to a pool full of sharks, he'll take it
Leave him in the wilderness with a sworn nemesis, he'll make it (He'll make it)
Take the gratitude from him, I bet he'll show you somethin', woah (Woah)
I chip a nigga lil' bit of nothin'
I chip a nigga lil' bit of nothin'
I chip a nigga lil' bit of nothin'
I chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, ""Bitch, I did that X-rated""
Johnny don't wanna go to school no more, no more
Johnny said books ain't cool no more (No more)
Johnny wanna be a rapper like his big cousin
Johnny caught a body yesterday out hustlin'
God bless America, you know we all love him
Yesterday, I got a call, like, from my dog, like 101
Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
He was sobbin', he was mobbin', way belligerent and drunk
Talkin' out his head, philosophin' on what the Lord had done
He said, ""K-Dot, can you pray for me? It been a fucked up day for me
I know that you anointed, show me how to overcome""
He was lookin' for some closure, hopin' I could bring him closer
To the spiritual, my spirit do know better, but I told him
""I can't sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how I feel
If somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin' killed
Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of
All the memories collected, moments you could never touch
I wait in front a nigga's spot and watch him hit his block
I catch a nigga leavin' service if that's all I got
I chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, ""Bitch, I did that""
Ain't no Black Power when your baby killed by a coward
I can't even keep the peace, don't you fuck with one of ours
It be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour
Ghetto bird be on the street, paramedics on the dial
Let somebody touch my mama, touch my sister, touch my woman
Touch my daddy, touch my niece, touch my nephew, touch my brother
You should chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Matter fact, I'm 'bout to speak at this convention, call you back""[Segue: Kendrick Lamar]

Barricaded blocks and borders

Corporate offices, banks, employees, and bosses with
Homicidal thoughts, Donald Trump's in office
We lost Barack and promised to never doubt him again
But is America honest or do we bask in sin?
Pass the gin, I mix it with American blood
Then bash him in, you Crippin' or you married to Blood?
I'll ask again, oops, accident
It's nasty when you set us up then roll the dice, then bet us up
You overnight the big rifles, then tell Fox to be scared of us

Why do I even care?
How are you all around me, when you're not really there? (Mm)
When you're not really there? (Hey, yeah, mm)

The line ""every time I'm with you, I go into a zone"" suggests that Grande feels completely consumed by her lover's presence, and the repeated phrase ""take me all the way"" emphasizes her desire to be physically and emotionally close with him.

However, Grande also acknowledges the challenges in their relationship. The lines ""why do you say you want me, then tell me you're not coming in"" and ""why don't we face the danger, just for the night and forget"" suggest that there are communication issues between the couple, and that they may be avoiding facing the problems in their relationship.

In the bridge, Grande asks her lover to ""remind me why we're taking a break"", suggesting that the couple is currently separated. The repetition of the line ""we both know what we want"" implies that the couple is aware of their desire for one another, but they may be hesitant to act on it due to fear or insecurities.

Overall, ""Touch It"" is a song about the complexities of a relationship and the struggle to balance desire with fear. The song encourages taking risks and being vulnerable in order to fully experience love and connection with another person. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Ariana+Grande/_/Touch+It"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

I bought a castle in France and it's the same one I built in the sand for you when I was two
I thought I painted a picture of Heaven
But it turns out it's just your room, just your room
I'd run off the end of the earth just to see if you'd catch me
When I know you'd let me fall every time

All I do is wish that I could change myself
I wish that I could change, but (All I do)

Oh, I hate the way (I need to be loved by you)

Everybody knows
Catch me or I go Houdini

Come in closer, are you readin' my lips?

But do you practise everything that you preach? (Ah-ah)
I need something that'll make me believe

[Verse 1]
I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
, 
all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room
[Pre-Chorus]
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)
[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
[Verse 2]
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed[Pre-Chorus]
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?
(A tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)
[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
[Bridge]
I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out
""She's laughing up at us from Hell""
[Breakdown]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me

[Verse 1]
When I get older, losing my hair
Many years from now
Will you still be sending me a valentine
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine?
If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
[Bridge]
Oooh, you'll be older too  (Aaaah)
And if you say the word
I could stay with you
[Verse 2]
I could be handy mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings go for a ride
Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
[Bridge]
Every summer, we can rent a cottage
In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save (We shall scrimp and save)
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera, Chuck, and Dave[Verse 3]
Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Yours sincerely, wasting away
Give me your answer, fill in a form
Mine for evermore
Will you still need me, will you still feed me

[Verse 1]
Betty, I won't make assumptions
About why you switched your homeroom, but
I think it's 'cause of me
Betty, one time, I was riding on my skateboard
When I passed your house
It's like I couldn't breathe
[Pre-Chorus]
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time, it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you
[Chorus]
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you
[Verse 2]
Betty, I know where it all went wrong
Your favorite song was playing
From the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found
I hate the crowds, you know that
Plus, I saw you dance with him[Pre-Chorus]
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time, it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you
[Chorus]
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you
[Bridge]
I was walking home on broken cobblestones
Just thinking of you when she pulled up like
A figment of my worst intentions
She said, ""James, get in, let's drive""
Those days turned into nights
Slept next to her, but
I dreamt of you all summer long[Verse 3]
Betty, I'm here on your doorstep
And I planned it out for weeks now
But it's finally sinkin' in
Betty, right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens when
You see my face again
[Pre-Chorus]
The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you
So I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party
[Chorus]
Yeah, I showed up at your party
Will you have me? Will you love me?
Will you kiss me on the porch
In front of all your stupid friends?
If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?
Will it patch your broken wings?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

Standing in your cardigan
Kissin' in my car again
Stopped at a streetlight
You know I miss you",https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-betty-lyrics,"""betty"" is the fourteenth track from Taylor Swift's eighth studio album, folklore. It was released on July 24, 2020, through Republic Records.

[Verse 1]
My old man is a bad man
But I can't deny, the way he holds my hand
And he grabs me, he has me by my heart
He doesn't mind I have a Las Vegas past
He doesn't mind I have a L.A. crass way about me
He loves me with every beat of his cocaine heart
[Refrain]
Swimmin' pool, glimmering darlin'
White bikini off with my red nail polish
Watch me in the swimming pool, bright blue ripples
You sittin', sippin' on your Black Cristal, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
Light of my life, fire of my loins
Be a good baby, do what I want
Light of my life, fire of my loins
Gimme them gold coins, gimme them coins
[Chorus]
And I'm off to the races
Cases of Bacardi chasers
Chasin' me all over town
'Cause he knows I'm wasted
Facin' time again at Rikers Island
And I won't get out
Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet
Singin' in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouth
Ready for you[Verse 2]
My old man is a tough man
But he got a soul as sweet as blood red jam
And he shows me, he knows me, every inch of my tar black soul
He doesn't mind I have a flat, broke-down life
In fact, he says he thinks it's what he might like about me
Admires me, the way I roll like a rollin' stone
[Refrain]
Likes to watch me in the glass room, bathroom, Chateau Marmont
Slippin' on my red dress, puttin' on my makeup
Glass room, perfume, cognac, lilac fumes
Says it feels like heaven to him
[Pre-Chorus]
Light of his life, fire of his loins
Keep me forever, tell me you own me
Light of your life, fire of your loins
Tell me you own me, gimme them coins
[Chorus]
And I'm off to the races
Cases of Bacardi chasers
Chasin' me all over town
'Cause he knows I'm wasted
Facin' time again at Rikers Island
And I won't get out
Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet
Singin' in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouth
Yo, I'm off to the races, laces
Leather on my waist is tight
And I am falling down
I can see your face is shameless
Cipriani's basement
Love you, but I'm going down
God, I'm so crazy, baby
I'm sorry that I'm misbehaving
I'm your little harlot, starlet
Queen of Coney Island
Raisin' hell all over town
Sorry 'bout it[Bridge]
My old man is a thief
And I'm gonna stay and pray with him 'til the end
But I trust in the decision of the Lord to watch over us
Take him when He may, if He may
I'm not afraid to say that I'd die without him
Who else is gonna put up with me this way?
I need you, I breathe you, I'd never leave you
They would rue the day I was alone without you
You're lying with your gold chain on
Cigar hangin' from your lips
I said, ""Hon', you never looked so beautiful
As you do now, my man""
[Chorus]
And we're off to the races, places
Ready, set, the gate is down
And now we're goin' in
To Las Vegas, chaos, Casino Oasis
Honey, it is time to spin
Boy, you're so crazy, baby
I love you forever, not maybe
You are my one true love
You are my one true love

Some L.A. Niggaz Lyrics
Track 17 off of Dr. Dre’s 2nd album 2001 and the first song after the breakup of N.W.A in 1991 in which Dr. Dre and MC Ren appear together.

Note that each verse starts with a line from a classic L.A. rap…

[Intro: MC Ren]
Yeah, nigga, MC Ren up in this motherfucker
(West West, y'all)
Yeah, L.A. niggas
L.A. niggas rule the world, nigga
Y'all niggas gotta recognize, you know what I’m sayin’?
Niggas don't wanna peep game, you know what I’m sayin’?
But this shit come all the way back around here
My nigga Dre, droppin' heat rocks on y'all bitch-ass
You know what I’m sayin’? You gotta recognize
L.A. niggas, connected all over the motherfucking world, nigga
Recognize this – peep game
[Verse 1: Time Bomb]
Now in my younger days, I used to sport a rag
Backpack full of cans, plus a four-four mag
G'd up from the feet up
Blue'd up from the shoe up, how I grew up
Loc'n, smokin' and drinkin' 'til we threw up ('Til we threw up)
At 
Leimert Park
, taggin', hittin' fools up
Ditching my class, just to fuck yo' school up
You don't wanna blast, nigga, tuck yo' tool up
But don't sleep, young niggas quick to shoot you
Now there's another motherfucker with no future
But Time Bomb much smoother when I maneuver, dope like Cuba
Got 'em jumpin', 
Disciples to the Hoover[Verse 2: King T]
I'm coming ""Straight Outta Compton"" with a loose cannon
Smoke big green, call it Bruce Banner
Watch your manners; 
at last, another blast from the top notch
From way back with the Pop Rocks
, I pop lock witcha
Picture this: Dr. Dre twisting wit' 
Tha Liks
And Hittman bought a fix
Don't trip, it's a Time Bomb in this bitch
Hear it tick, tick, tick, tick— *boom*
Wait a minute, it's on; I tell it like a true mackadelic
Weed and cocaine sold separate, check it
From sundown to sun up, clown and run up
The 
Aftermath'll
 be two in your gut, nigga what?
[Hook: Knoc-Turn'al & Kokane]
We roll deep, smoke on weed, drink and pack heat
Requirements for survival each day in L.A.!
It don't stop, we still mash in hot pursuit from the cops
Analyze why we act this way in L.A.!
[Verse 3: Hittman & 
Xzibit
]
Gimme that mic, fool, it's a West Coast jack move
They call me Hitt, 'cause I spit like gats do
Cock me back
Bust caps for my Macz Crew
, at 
Fairfax
We used to wear Air Max shoes, that's true
But I grew up where niggas jack you, harass you
Blast you for that set you claim (Where you from?)
Mash on you for your Turkish chain, 
CK, BK
Blue'd up or flame, I ran wit a gang
I helped niggas get jacked for they Dana Danes
My pants hang below my waistline
I look humble; wanna rumble? (Yeah, yeah)
I bang though, like Vince Carter from the baseline
Don't waste my time
Fuck a scrap in killa Cali, AKs and 9s
One-times, sunshines and fine-ass bitches
Hawaiian Thai,
 drive-bys, six-fo's on switches[Verse 4: Xzibit]
I was raised in the hood called
 
WHAT-THE-DIF'
Where the brothers in the hood refused to go Hollywood
Slugs for the fuck of it
Anybody hatin' on us can suck a dick
If I catch you touching mine, you catch a flat-line, dead on the floor
Better than yours, driving away, gettin' head from a whore
It's 
AvireX-to-the-Z
Fuckin' with me might get you banned from TV, cassette, and CD
It's all mine, the whole nine, the right time
Multiply, we don't die,
 the streets don't lie
What? So neither do I; I'm bad for your health
Like puttin' a pistol up to your face and blastin' yourself
[Verse 5: Defari]
Five in the mornin', burglars at my do'
Glock 45 in my dresser drawer
Let 'em come in — BOW, he see the thunder roll
Roll with niggas who buy fifths by the fo'
And brews by the case
Slap you in the face with the bass 
Dr. Dre laced
Likwit Kings with Sedans and gold rings
Haters scope the style, but can't find no openings
[Hook: Knoc-Turn'al, Kokane]
We roll deep, smoke on weed, drink and pack heat
Requirements for survival each day in L.A.!
It don't stop, we still mash in hot pursuit from the cops
Analyze why we act this way in L.A.![Outro]
In L.A. –
That's how we ride
That's how we ride
That's how we ride
That's how we ride",https://genius.com/Dr-dre-some-la-niggaz-lyrics,"",""

[Part I]
[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
What money got to do with it
When I don't know the full definition of a rap image?
I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Institutionalized, I keep runnin' back for a visit, hol' up
Get it back
I said I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Institutionalized,
 
I could still kill me a nigga, so what?
[Interlude: Anna Wise & Bilal]
If I was the president
I'd pay my mama's rent
Free my homies and them
Bulletproof my Chevy doors
Lay in the White House and get high, Lord
Whoever thought?
Master, take the chains off me!
[Part II]
[Intro: Taz Arnold]
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom, shit[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Life, can be like, a box of chocolate
Quid pro quo, somethin' for somethin', that's the obvious
Oh shit, flow's so sick, don't you swallow it
Bitin' my style, you're salmonella poison positive
I can just alleviate the rap industry politics
Milk the game up, never lactose intolerant
The last remainder of real shit, you know the obvious
Me, scholarship? No, streets put me through colleges
Be all you can be, true, but the problem is
Dream only a dream if work don't follow it
Remind me of the homies that used to know me, now follow this
I'll tell you my hypothesis, I'm probably just way too loyal
K Dizzle will do it for you, my niggas think I'm a god
Truthfully all of 'em spoiled, usually, you're never charged
But somethin' came over you once I took you to them fuckin' BET Awards
You lookin' at artistses like they're harvestses
So many Rollies around you and you want all of 'em
Somebody told me you thinkin' 'bout snatchin' jewelry
I should've listened when my grandmama said to me:
[Chorus: Bilal]
""Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, boy
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Oh now, slow down""[Bridge: Snoop Dogg]
And once upon a time, in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was five-foot somethin', God bless the kid
Took his homies to the show and this is what they said:
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
""Fuck am I 'posed to do when I'm lookin' at walkin' licks?
The constant big money talk 'bout the mansion and foreign whips
The private jets and passport, presidential glass floor
Gold bottles, gold models, givin' up the ass for
Instagram flicks, suckin' dick, fuck is this?
One more sucker wavin' with a flashy wrist
My defense mechanism tell me to get him
Quickly because he got it
It's a recession, then why the fuck he at King of Diamonds?
No more livin' poor, meet my four-four
When I see 'em, put the per diem on the floor
Now Kendrick, know they're your co-workers
But it's gon' take a lot 'fore this pistol go cold turkey
Now I can watch his watch on the TV and be okay
But see I'm on the clock once that watch landin' in LA
Remember steal from the rich and givin' it back to the poor
?
Well, that's me at these awards""
I guess my grandmama was warnin' a boy
She said[Chorus: Bilal]
""Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, boy
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Oh now, slow down""
[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
And once upon a time, in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was five-foot something, dazed and confused
Talented but still under the neighborhood ruse
You can take your boy out the hood
But you can't take the hood out the homie
Took his show money, stashed it in the mozey wozey
Hollywood's nervous
Fuck you, goodnight, thank you much for your service",https://genius.com/Kendrick-lamar-institutionalized-lyrics,"While “King Kunta” shows Lamar at a high, confidently claiming his throne atop the rap game with the influence and success he has acquired, “Institutionalized” is the dramatic realization that the murky past of the m.A.A.d. city still lurks within Lamar’s psyche.

We are all at some level ‘institutionalized.’ The poor and disenfranchised are institutionalized by prison, racism, classism, and the rich and the powerful are institutionalized by fear, dogma, and the almighty dollar. Everyone is a loser in this game, perspective is the only answer.

The word institutionalized also has connotations of insanity. Those who are institutionalized are taught something is “wrong” with them, but perhaps it’s the institution that’s wrong.

According to Songfacts, Anna Wise, who provides backing vocals, said to Billboard magazine:

""I just kept going back and forth with him. He would fly me out and I would stay for extended periods of time. Even up to about a month after GKMC came out, I was kind of jumping around, I wasn’t really staying in Boston at that time. I was upstate [New York], I was in San Francisco. Sonnymoon did three tours – so we had a lot of stuff going on. But in between that, I would always come back to him."" <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Kendrick+Lamar/_/Institutionalized"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

You hit me up, it's late at night
This is the same old story
Your friends should take your phone away

Ooh, you give me a little taste

[Part I: End]
[Verse]
Darker times
 
(
Oh my God, this is my song
)
They're telling boulder-heavy lies
 
(
Don't play with me right now
, what?)
Looks like all we've got is each other
 
(
Ah
)
The truth is obsolete
 
(
Yes
, I can listen to it)
Remember when all I had was my mother
 
(
Haha
, let them sing)
She didn't compromise
She could recognize
Voodoo
Our daughters and our sons
 
(See, all that is unnecessary)
Are just candles in the sun
 
(
Mmcht, huh, haha
)
Voodoo
Don't let him see divide, hmm
 
(I'm just playin', so tell me how I skate? 
What you mean?
)
Don't you let her see divide
 
(You said you could tell a lot about a man by the way he skates, so how do I skate?)
Voodoo
 
(
I don't know
, just be real)
[Chorus]
She's got the whole wide world in her juicy fruit
 
(
You, you're alright
, heh)
He's got the whole wide world in his pants
 
(
There's somethin' about you
, huh, I don't know)
He wrapped the whole wide world in a wedding band
 
(
I can't believe I'm even talking to you and telling you this right now
)
Then put the whole wide world on her hands
She's got the whole wide world in her hands
 
(
You special
, heh, I don't know about that)
He's got the whole wide world in his hands
 
(
I wish you could see what I see
, hmm)
In his hands

He wrapped the whole wide world in a wedding band
Then put the whole wide world on her hands

[Part II: Golden Girl]
[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
She peels an orange for us in the morning
She woke me up to give me half
I can hear the children soccer ballin'
Like wildcats running on the grass, hey
You're a girl on this island
I'm a boy from America
My flight leaves tonight
But I don't think I'm going backwards
I won't be going backwards
[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
You're my golden girl
You're the one I've chosen, girl
You're 24K
You make it bright when it's grey
You're my golden girl
The sun has been kind to you
You're 24K (Girl)
But the sky's never grey (Never grey)[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Silent moments, meditative poses
You break my focus, you make me laugh
Two mopeds racing through the forest
Making dirt clouds on a path, on a path
I'm my best on this island
I'm a mess in America
My flight left last night
But I know I'm not going back home, yeah
I'm not going back home, no
[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
You're my golden girl
You're the one I've chosen, girl
You're 24K
You make it bright when it's grey
You're my golden girl
The sun has been kind to you
You're 24K (Girl)
But the sky's never grey (Never grey)
[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
If we build a house in paradise, will we get to heaven still?
(Tropic, tropic, tropic, breezes, breezes, breezes)
If we don't have to live through hell just to get to heaven
(Tropic, tropic, tropic, breezes, breezes, breezes, breezes)
I'ma stay right here, with you
(Tropic, tropic, tropic, breezes, breezes, breezes, breezes)
'Til the hurricane comes, 'til the tsunami comes
(Tropic, tropic, tropic, breezes)
I've found my gold[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
You're my golden girl
You're the one I've chosen, girl
You're 24K
You make it bright when it's grey
You're my golden girl
The sun has been kind to you
You're 24K (Girl)
But the sky's never grey (Never grey)
[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Um, you're my G-O L-D E-N G-I R-L
And that's for the females that can't spell, but
Um, thanks for fuckin' with me
You turn my dark into light, you're like a bucket of bleach
You see, I want you to know that
My negatives at home aren't working for my Kodak
So that means that I don't want to go back
Just know that I would like to stay here and hold that
Hand of yours, girl, I'm a wreck in America
Your face is the best
'Cause it's the same color as the lace on my neck
And you're golden, uh, your eyes open, fuck it
Let's toast and listen to Michael Bolton
I free-fall off the hill again
Let's see where I land, I'm like Gilligan
Um, I trust you, Golden, for wed ring
I'm just hopin' that you don't turn my neck green

[Verse 1]
I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room, at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn away
But you stayed
This morning, I said we should talk about it
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said, ""Okay, let's talk""
And I said
[Chorus]
Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay
[Verse 2]
Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now, I'm always laughing
And I love you because you have given me
No choice but to
[Chorus]
Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay[Bridge]
You took the time to memorize me
My fears, my hopes, and dreams
I just like hanging out with you all the time
All those times that you didn't leave, it's been occurring to me
I'd like to hang out with you for my whole life
[Breakdown]
Stay and I'll be loving you for quite some time
No one else is gonna love me when I get mad, mad, mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay!

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay

No Love Allowed Lyrics
[Verse 1]
911, it's a critical emergency, yeah
Better run-run-run
Come and charge him with the 1-4-3, yeah
Told me this world was mine
Such a beautiful lie
Now it's done, done, done
And his love is no more for me
Hand in the air as he waved me goodbye
He say he care, but no tears in his eyes
And ask me if I'm alright
Nigga, is you blind?
[Chorus]
Like a bullet, your love hit me to the core
I was flying 'til you knocked me to the floor
And it's so foolish how you keep me wanting more
I'm screaming murderer, how could you murder us?
I call it murder, no love allowed
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 2]
Fi-Fo-Fum, like the sky is falling down on me
Numb-numb-numb
He so cold, he doesn't feel a thing
Broken heart was the case
Go on and put him away
He's the only one-one-one I ever let get the best of me
Hand in the air as he waved me goodbye
He say he care, but no tears in his eyes
And ask me if I'm alright
Nigga, is you blind?[Chorus]
Like a bullet, your love hit me to the core
I was flying 'til you knocked me to the floor
And it's so foolish how you keep me wanting more

Usually I'm the one that they cry for
But this man, he's the one that I'd die for
Mama said there's no 'cause for a rebel
Do you hear me now?
No love, no love, no love allowed

Like a bullet, your love hit me to the core
I was flying 'til you knocked me to the floor

A moderate commercial success, the track is one of the band's most critically acclaimed, receiving praise for contemplating the fleeting nature of life with depth and maturity.

""Night Changes"" was revealed as the album's second single in an interview with radio host Scott Mills. The track was released on 14 November 2014, three days before the album's release.

Developing on the themes of ""Live While We're Young"" and ""Story of My Life"", the song explores the rapid passage of time, seizing the moment in life, and gaining love along the way. The harmonies in the chorus, backed by rounds of ""Oohs"", give the song added depth and a ""big contemplative feel.""

The official music video was released on 21 November 2014 and directed by Ben Winston. This was the last video of One Direction with the member Zayn as he departed from the band on 25 March 2015. Liam Payne's real-life girlfriend Sophia Smith was involved in the shoot, but did not appear on-screen.

The video is a point of view of going on a date with all members of One Direction. The five dates take place in five different locations: a date with Zayn at an Italian restaurant (which apparently he owns as he greets cooks in the back and introduces his date to a waiter), a drive in the country with Louis, a night in playing Monopoly and Jenga next to a fireplace with Niall, ice skating with Harry and at a carnival with Liam.

As their date progresses, it goes from best to worst. Zayn's date's ex-boyfriend comes in and pours water and food on Zayn, which prompts her to leave Zayn as he looks on in disbelief. Next, Harry spots a couple doing a trick on the ice rink and attempts to do it with his date, but both wound up being injured. Liam and his date go on a ride in the carnival, but Liam becomes nauseated and throws up in his date's hat. Niall tends to his fireplace, but his sweater catches on fire and goes to grab a towel to put it out, only to tip over a jug that stains his date's dress. Lastly, Louis gets pulled over by the police and attempts to joke with the policeman, who becomes displeased and places Louis under arrest, and the date sees Louis in the back of the police car heading away from her. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/One+Direction/_/Night+Changes"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Justin Bieber - MLK Interlude (Traducción al Español) Lyrics
[Letra de ""Justin Bieber - MLK Interlude (Traducción al Español)""]
[Hablado: Martin Luther King Jr.]
Te digo esta mañana, que si nunca has encontrado algo tan querido y tan preciado para ti que vas a morir por ello, entonces no estás en condiciones de vivir
Puede que tengas treinta y ocho años como yo
Y un día se te presenta una gran oportunidad
Y te pide que defiendas algún gran principio
Algún gran problema, alguna gran causa
Y te niegas a hacerlo porque tienes miedo
Te niegas a hacerlo porque quieres vivir más
Tienes miedo de perder tu trabajo
O tienes miedo de que te critiquen
O que perderás tu popularidad
O tienes miedo de que alguien te apuñale o dispare o bombardee tu casa
Y entonces te niegas a subir al estrado
Bueno, puedes seguir y vivir hasta los noventa
Pero estás tan muerto a los treinta y ocho como a los noventa
Y la sensación de respirar en tu vida no es más que el anuncio tardío de una muerte anterior del espíritu
Moriste cuando te negaste a defender el derecho
Moriste cuando te negaste a defender la verdad
Moriste cuando te negaste a defender la justicia",https://genius.com/Genius-traducciones-al-espanol-justin-bieber-mlk-interlude-traduccion-al-espanol-lyrics,"This interlude is an excerpt from what is considered a rare Martin Luther King, Jr sermon.

And although I promised that I couldn't stay, baby

Every promise don't work out that way

Dishes smashed on my counter from our last encounter
Pictures snatched out the frame
Bitch, I scratched out your name and your face
What is it about you that I can't erase, baby?

I feel so ordinary, sad when you around me
Treat me like corduroy, wear me out
Arguments, you air me out
Tripping 'bout your whereabouts
I can't keep no conflict with you, boy, can we just rub it out?
I don't want no static with you
, 
you know you my plug
And I can't shake this habit, no
[Pre-Chorus]
I've been up, baby
Heavy reminiscin'
Heavy on the missing you
Wish it was different than what it was (Oh, no)
I've been up, baby
Lost in the lie of us
Lost, ain't no findin' us
I've been up, baby
[Chorus]
And if you wonder if I hate you (I do)
Shitty of you to make me feel just like this
What I would do to make you feel just like this
And if you wondered if I hate you (Fuck you)
Shitty of you to make me feel just likе this
What I would do to make you feel just like this[Verse 2]
Used to bе too solid 'til you scrambled me
Used to be your rider, you mishandle me
Used to be nonviolent 'til you ambushed me
Now I'm out here wildin' with you
Now I'm out here, silent treatment, that mean no permission (No)
Missionary gettin' boring, can you switch positions? (Yeah)
Hard to save your soul, you don't ever listen, no (No)
[Pre-Chorus]
I've been up, baby
Heavy reminiscin'
Heavy on the missing you

​camera roll Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Don't go through your camera roll
So much you don't know that you've forgotten
What a trip, the way you can flip
Through all the good parts of it, I shouldn't have done it
[Chorus]
Chronological order and nothing but torture
Scroll too far back, that's what you get
I don't wanna see 'em but I can't delete 'em
It just doesn't feel right yet, not yet
[Verse 2]
All the best, that's all that's left
Cruel evidence, it does me no favors
I should know it's a place not to go
When I'm alone, I'll just feel bad later
[Chorus]
Chronological order and nothing but torture
Scroll too far back, that's what you get
I don't wanna see 'em but I can't delete 'em
It just doesn't feel right yet, not yet
[Bridge]
Hmm
Look at me, I'm living all alone
And now you're only living in my phone[Outro]
Anyway, thanks for all the nights and the days
And everything that you gave, I'll never erase it
There's one where we look so in love
Before we lost all the sun
 
and I made you take it",https://genius.com/Kacey-musgraves-camera-roll-lyrics,"",""

The song gained critical acclaim and won the Grammy for “Best Country Duo Performance” at the 2025 Grammy awards.

Beyoncé and Miley’s signature voices intertwine seamlessly, with the intricate, drawn-in song gradually building in intensity as it approaches the rousing crescendo of the hook.

Beyoncé answers any doubts about the extent to which COWBOY CARTER will be a ‘country’ album by leading ‘II MOST WANTED’ with a simple, acoustic guitar.
The sparse ambience of the track captures the spirit of the record as a whole, with the outro of ‘II MOST WANTED’ pivoting around Beyoncé's layered vocals, giving the song a hymnal feel.

At its heart, ‘II MOST WANTED’ is a song about loyalty and holding onto the passion of young love, with Beyoncé and Miley Cyrus celebrating their sense of freedom as they ride off into the sunset. It's open to interpretation whether the two protagonists are singing to their respective lovers or to one another during the song, but based on the chemistry that permeates ‘II MOST WANTED’, the latter seems most likely.

They reference ‘jumping the gun’ and admit that they've leapt into the romance with both feet, but they shrug their shoulders and cast any doubts aside in the name of seizing the day. Beyoncé highlights that she wasn't sure what she was looking for before she met her partner, and that this moment represented the birth of ‘a new me’ <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Beyonc%C3%A9/_/II+MOST+WANTED"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

[Intro]
Ah!
[Verse 1]
Hello
The sunny place for shady people
A crowded room where nobody goes
You can be whoever you wanna be here
And, oh
I've been livin' at the Chateau
Shouldn't drive, but I should really go home
I don't even know 'em, but they won't leave here

Frightened by my own reflection
Desperate for a new connection
Pull you in, but don't you get too close
Love you now, but not tomorrow
Wrong to steal, but not to borrow
Pull you in, but don't you get too close
[Chorus]
I've been California dreamin'
Plastic hearts are bleedin'
Keep me up all night (Keep me up)
Keep me up all night (All night)
Lost in black hole conversation
Sunrise suffocation

Keep me up all night[Post-Chorus]

I'll tell you all the people I know (I know)
Sell you somethin' that you already own (You own)

Fill me up, but leave me hollow

Don't you fight

Rock and Roll Ain’t Noise Pollution Lyrics
“Rock and Roll Ain’t Noise Pollution” is the 4th single (and final track) from AC/DC’s album Back in Black. The song reached number 15 on the UK singles charts, the highest placing of any song on the album.
[Intro]
Alright
Hey there, all you middle-men
Throw away your fancy clothes
And while you're out there sittin' on a fence
So get off your ass and come down here
'Cause rock and roll ain't no riddle, man
To me, it makes good, good sense
Good sense, yeah, let's go
Ow
Ooh, yes
[Verse 1]
Heavy decibels are playin' on my guitar
We got vibrations comin' up from the floor
We're just listenin' to the rock that's givin' too much noise
Are you deaf? You wanna hear some more?
[Pre-Chorus]
We're just talkin' 'bout the future
Forget about the past
It'll always be with us
It's never gonna die, never gonna die
[Chorus]
Rock and roll ain't noise pollution
Rock and roll ain't gonna die
Rock and roll ain't noise pollution
Rock and roll, it will survive
Yes, it will, haha[Verse 2]
I took a look inside your bedroom door
You looked so good lyin' on your bed
When I asked you if you wanted any rhythm at all
You said, ""You wanna rock and roll instead?""
[Pre-Chorus]
We're just talkin' 'bout the future
Forget about the past
It'll always be with us
It's never gonna die, never gonna die

Rock and roll ain't noise pollution
Rock and roll ain't gonna die
Rock and roll ain't no pollution
Rock and roll, it's just rock and roll

Oh, rock and roll ain't noise pollution
Rock and roll ain't gonna die
Rock and roll ain't no pollution

My smoking gun
My eclipsed sun
This has broken me down
My twisted knife
My sleepless night

This has frozen my ground

Don't want no other shade of blue but you

You know I left a part of me back in New York
You knew the hero died so what's the movie for?
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
You knew the password so I let you in the door
You knew you won so what's the point of keeping score?
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
But what you did was just as dark
(Ah, ah, ah)
Darling, this was just as hard
As when they pulled me apart

Throughout the song, Swift reflects on the toll that this broken love has taken on her, describing it as a ""smoking gun"", ""twisted knife"", and ""barren land"".

[Intro]
How's your son?
(
All, all, all tha-thang, thang, all, all tha-thang, thang, thang
)
He made the team this year?
Aight, they said he wasn't tall enough
(
All, all that glitters is not gold, all gold is not reality, real is what you lays on me
)
Ma', we here, we gon' cook this Sunday, okay? So come by
Damn, that's your new girlfriend?
[Verse 1]
This is family business
And this is for the family that can't be with us
And this is for my cousin locked down, know the answer's in us
This why I spit it in my songs so sweet, like a photo of your granny's picture
Now that you're gone, it hit us
Super hard on Thanksgiving and Christmas, this can't be right
Yo, you heard the track I did, man? ""This Can't Be Life""
Somebody please say grace, so I can save face
And have a reason to cover my face
I even made you a plate, soul food, know how Granny do it
Monkey bread on the side, know how the family do it
When I brought it, why the guard had to look all through it?
As kids, we used to laugh, who knew that life would move this fast?
Who knew I'd have to look at you through a glass?
And look, you tell me you ain't did it, then you ain't did it
And if you did, then that's family business[Chorus]
And I don't care about (All, all, diamond ring, diamond ring)
They don't mean a thing
(All, all, all, tha-thang, thang, all, all tha-thang, thang, thang)
All these 
fancy
 things
I tell you that all is my weight in gold
(All, all that glitters is not gold, all gold is not reality, real is what you lays on me)
Now, all I know, I know all these things
[Verse 2]
Yeah, 
this is family business
And this is for everybody standing with us
Come on, let's take a family Grammy picture
Abi, remember when they ain't believe in me?
Now she like, ""See! That's my cousin on TV!""
Now, we gettin' it and we gon' make it
And they gon' hate it, and I'm his favorite
I can't deny it, I'm a straight rider
But when we get together, be Electric Slidin'
Grandma, get 'em shook up
Aw, naw, don't open the photobook up
I got a Aunt Ruth that can't remember your name
But I bet them Polaroids'll send her down memory lane
You know that one auntie, you don't mean to be rude
But every holiday, nobody eating her food
And you don't wanna stay there 'cause them your worst cousins
Got roaches at they crib like them your first cousins
Act like you ain't took a bath with your cousin
Fit three in the bed if it's six of y'all
I'm talkin' 'bout three by the head and three by the leg
But you ain't have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bed[Bridge]
Rain, rain, rain, go away
Let the sun come out and all the children say
 (Uh)
Rain, rain, rain, go away
 (Yeah)
Let the sun come out and all the children say
 (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
[Verse 3]
I woke up early this morning with a new state of mind
A creative way to rhyme without using nines and guns
Keep your nose out the sky, keep your heart to God
And keep your face to the risin' sun
All my niggas from the Chi' is my family, dawg
And my niggas ain't my guys, they my family, dawg
I feel like, one day, you'll understand me, dawg
You can still love your man and be manly, dawg
You ain't gotta get heated at every housewarmin'
Sittin' here, grillin' people like George Foreman
Why Uncle Ray and Aunt Sheila always performin'?
Second she storm out, then he storm in
Y'all gon' sit down, have a good time this reunion
And drink some wine like Communion
And act like everything fine and if it isn't
We ain't letting everybody in our family business, uh
[Chorus]
(
All, all, diamond ring, diamond ring
)
They don't mean a thing
(
All, all, all tha-thang, thang, all, all tha-thang, thang, thang
)
They don't mean a thing
(
All, all that glitters is not gold, all gold is not reality, real is what you lays on me
)
They don't mean a thing, a thing
And I don't care about
 (Woo! 
All, all, diamond ring, diamond ring
)
They don't mean a thing
 (
All, all, all tha-thang, thang, all, all tha-thang, thang, thang
)
All these fancy things
I tell you that all is my weight in gold
 
(
All, all that glitters is not gold, all gold is not reality, real is what you lays on me
)
And all I know, I know all these things[Outro]
All these things
CLK Mercedes 
Benz
All these things
A whole lotta money
All these things
Mommy and Daddy, can you please stop fighting?
All these things (And I don't care about)

The lyrics deal with the struggles and joys of a large family, and all the memories that are cherished by members as time passes by. When West struggled to come up with specific family scenarios to fill 3 whole verses, background vocalist Tarrey Torae (whose vocals are prominently featured in the outro) provided stories of her childhood, which West adapted into rhymes and formed into fully fleshed out verses.

The song received positive reviews from critics, and is now considered an overlooked gem on the album and in Kanye's discography as a whole. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Kanye+West/_/Family+Business"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

​breadwinner Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Here's what he'll do, he'll play it cool
When he hangs out with a woman like you
Say he ain't pressed by all your success
Tell you he's different than all of the rest
[Pre-Chorus]
You're gonna give it all and give it all
But you won't get it back
I'm tellin' you, it's gonna hurt
Stay away from a boy like that
[Chorus]
He wants a breadwinner
He wants your dinner
Until he ain't hungry anymore
He wants your shimmer
To make him feel bigger
Until he starts feelin' insecure
I wish somebody would've told me the truth
Say, ""He's never gonna know what to do
With a woman like you
With a woman like you""
[Verse 2]
I see the games a mile away
They only end when another heart breaks
But all of his wounds ain't an excuse
For you to put up with how he treats you[Pre-Chorus]
You're gonna give it all and give it all
But you won't get it back
I'm tellin' you, it's gonna hurt
Stay away from a boy like that
[Chorus]
He wants a breadwinner
He wants your dinner
Until he ain't hungry anymore
He wants your shimmer
To make him feel bigger
Until he starts feelin' insecure
I wish somebody would've told me the truth
Say, ""He's never gonna know what to do
With a woman like you
With a woman like you""
[Bridge]
I can sleep at night
Knowing I really tried
I put in the time
But the fault isn't mine
[Chorus]
That he wants a breadwinner
He wants your dinner
Until he ain't hungry anymore (Anymore)
He wants a breadwinner
He wants your dinner
Until he ain't hungry anymore (Anymore)
He wants your shimmer
To make him feel bigger
Until he starts feelin' insecure
I wish somebody would've told me the truth
Say, ""He's never gonna know what to do[Outro]
With a woman like you
With a woman like you
With a woman like you and me""
He likes what he sees",https://genius.com/Kacey-musgraves-breadwinner-lyrics,"",""

Just two different endings, you learn to repair

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
How we stop the Black Panthers?
Ronald Reagan cooked up an answer
You hear that? What Gil Scott was hearin'
When our heroes or heroines got hooked on heroin
Crack raised the murder rate in D.C. and Maryland
We invested in that, it's like we got Merrill lynched
And we been hangin' from the same tree ever since
Sometimes, I feel the music is the only medicine
So we, cook it, cut it, measure it, bag it, sell it
The fiends cop it, nowadays, they can't tell if
That's that good shit, we ain't sure, man
Put the CD on your tongue—yeah, that's pure, man[Chorus: Kanye West,

From the place where the fathers gone
The mothers is hardly home
And the maricons lock us up in the Audy Home
How the Mexicans say? ""We just tryin' to party, holmes""
They wanna pack us all in a box like styrofoam
Who gave Saddam anthrax?
George Bush got the answers
Back in the hood, it's a different type of chemical
Arm & Hammer baking soda, raised they whole quota
Right when our soldiers, ran for the stove 'cause...
Dreams of being Hova
Went from bein' a broke man to bein' a dopeman
To bein' the president—look, there's hope, man!
This that inspiration for the Moes and the Folks, man
Shorty come and see his momma straight overdosin'
And this is the soundtrack
This the type of music that you make when you 'round that[Chorus: Kanye West,

Our Father, give us this day, our daily bread
Before the feds give us these days and take our daily bread
See, I done did all this ol' bullshit
And to atone, I throw a lil' somethin'-somethin' on the pulpit
We took that shit, measured it, and then cooked that shit
And what we gave back was crack music
And now, we ooze it through they nooks and crannies
So our mamas ain't got to be they cooks and nannies
And we gon' repo everything they ever took from granny
Now, the former slaves trade hooks for Grammys

All of you Africans that know how to do things that's working for other people
Y'all need to open your own business
Save your money, quit paying motherfuckers for jheri curls
Quit paying motherfuckers for perms
Save your money, start your own business
So all these little Africans will have wa— places to work
This is our future right here
This our future right here (
Right there

This— (
The new generation is goin', the new generation

Hey, I'ma tell you right now
If— If— If I have to die today, for this little African right here to have a future, I'm a dead motherfucker (
You right, respect

Wake up, jumped out my bed
I'm in a two man cell with my homie
 
Lil 1/2 Dead
Murder was the case that they gave me
Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?
I'm only eighteen, so I'm a young buck
It's a riot, if I don't scrap, I'm gettin' stuck
But that's the life of a G, I guess
Eses way deep, shanked two in the chest
Best run 'cause brothers is droppin' quicker
Uh, too late, damn, down goes another nigga
Bouncin' off the walls, throwing them dunks
Gettin' that rep as a young hog
It ain't nothin' like the street life
You better be strapped with your shank, 'cause ain't no fist fight
So I guess I gots to handle mine
Since I did the crime, I gots to do my time[
Chorus: Daz Dillinger
 & 
Donny Hathaway

Them say me grow up to be nothin'
Look at me now and tell me what you see
I am what I am, it's only me
Little ghetto boy
Playin' in the ghetto street
What you gonna do when you grow up
And have to face responsibility?
[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Now I'm holdin' a dub, sittin' on swoll
Twenty-seven years old, up for parole, stroll
I'm back up on my feet 
with my mind on the money
That I'll be makin' soon as I touch the streets
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump, but now they blast, right
But it ain't no thang to me
'Cause now I'm what they call a loced-assed OG
The lil' homies from the hood with grip
Are the ones I get with 'cause I'm down to set trip
Nigga, I'm bigger than you, so what you wanna do?
Didn't know he had a 
twenty-two
Straight sittin' behind his back
I grabbed his pockets and then I heard six caps
I fell to the ground with blood on my hands
I didn't understand
How a nigga so young could bust a cap
I used to be the same way back
I guess that's what I get (
For what?
)
For tryin' to jack the lil' homies for they grip[Chorus: Daz Dillinger & 
Donny Hathaway
]
Me learn many things from what me see from the street
The outcome of what I've come to be
Little ghetto boy
Playin' in the ghetto street
What you gonna do when you grow up
And have to face responsibility?
[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Somethin' for the real OGs to get with
Some facts, made our made, now you runnin' but don't play
Like every single day, really, though
You know me, I'm the smooth 
macadamien
, gamin' them for my homie
No needing bein' calm if you pack right
And earnin' just enough to keep your sack right
Late nights, I wonder what they gettin' for?
Early mornin' on the corners, what they hittin' for?
Seven young G's put they serve down
In a G ride, east side's where they swerve now
Not thinkin' about what's really goin' on
Got crept on, stepped on, now they gone
I spent four years in the county with nothin' but convicts around me
But now I'm back at the Pound
And we expose ways for the youth to survive
Some think it's wrong but we tend to think it's right
So make all them ends you can make
'Cause when you're broke, you break, check it out
So ain't no need for your mama to trip
'Cause you's a hustlin'-ass youngster, clockin' your grip[Chorus: Daz Dillinger &

Well, the road rolls out like a welcome mat
To a better place than the one we're at
And I ain't got no kinda plan
But I've had all of this town I can stand

And I got friends out on the coast
We can jump in the water and see what floats
We've been savin' for a rainy day
Let's beat the storm and be on our way

And it don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And, honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice

I can be your lucky penny
You can be my four-leaf clover
Startin' over
[Verse 3]
This might not be an easy time
There's rivers to cross and hills to climb
Some days, we might fall apart
And some nights might feel cold and dark[Verse 4]
But nobody wins afraid of losin'
And the hard roads are the ones worth choosin'
Someday, we'll look back and smile
And know it was worth every mile
[Pre-Chorus]
And it don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And, honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice

One, two, three and to the four
Snoop Doggy Dogg and Dr. Dre is at the door
Ready to make an entrance so back on up
'Cause you know we're 'bout to rip shit up
Give me the microphone first, so I can bust like a bubble
Compton and Long Beach together, now you know you in trouble
Ain't nothin' but a ""G"" thang, baby
Two loced out niggas goin' crazy
Death Row is the label that pays me
Unfadeable so please don't try to fade this (
Hell yeah
)
But, um, back to the lecture at hand
Perfection is perfected, so I'ma let 'em understand
From a young G's perspective
And before me dig out a bitch, I have to find a contraceptive
You never know, she could be earnin' her man and learnin' her man
And at the same time burnin' her man
Now, you know I ain't with that shit, Lieutenant
Ain't no pussy good enough to get burnt while I'm up in it (
Yeah
)
And that's realer than Real-Deal Holyfield
And now you hookers and hoes know how I feel
Well, if it's good enough to get broke off a proper chunk
I'll take a small piece of some of that funky stuff

Well, I'm peepin' and I'm creepin' and I'm creepin'
But I damn near got caught 'cause my beeper kept beepin'
Now it's time for me to make my impression felt
So sit back, relax, and strap on your seat belt
You never been on a ride like this before
With a producer who can rap and control the micstro
At the same time with the dope rhyme that I kick
You know and I know, I flow some old funky shit
To add to my collection, the selection
Symbolizes dope, take a toke, but don't choke
If you do, you'll have no clue
Of what me and my homie Snoop Dogg came to do

Dr. Dre

Gettin' funky on the mic like a old batch of collard greens
It's the capital S, oh, yes, I'm fresh, N-double-O-P
D-O-double-G-Y, D-O-double-G, you see
Showin' much flex when it's time to wreck a mic
Pimpin' hoes and clockin' a grip like my name was Dolemite
Yeah, and it don't quit

Is where it takes place, so when asked, your attention

Droppin' the funky shit that's makin' the sucker niggas mumble
When I'm on the mic, it's like a cookie, they all crumble
Try to get close and your ass'll get smacked
My motherfuckin' homie Doggy Dogg has got my back
Never let me slip, 'cause if I slip, then I'm slippin'
But if I got my nina, then you know I'm straight trippin'
And I'ma continue to put the rap down, put the mack down
And if you bitches talk shit, I have to put the smack down
Yeah, and you don't stop
I told you I'm just like a clock when I tick and I tock
But I'm never off, always on to the break of dawn

[Intro]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
[Verse]
Let me set the scene
Two lovers ripped right at the seams
They woke up from the perfect dream
And then the darkness came
I signed the papers yesterday
You came and took your things away
I moved out of the home we made
And gave you back your name
[Chorus]
What have we done?
Did we fly too high just to get burned by the sun?
No one's to blame
'Cause we called all the angels to save us
Called them by name
But I guess they got lost
Star-crossed

There is somethin' between us
I can see it right now

’Til my love came around
Now I just come on over
Show you how we get down
Shawty, you can get blazed

I can't believe that you are here
I can't believe it's happening
What are the odds that you'd appear?
The universe so vast to me
Seven billion is on the Earth
Could've been anywhere, but you're here with me
Should I play Lotto? What's it worth?
I must be on, so clear to me

Or somethin' we don't see just right
[Pre-Chorus]
Boy, come on, put your lipstick on (No one can tell you nothin')
Come on and walk this way through the fire (Don't care what's on their mind)

Why do you care so much whose **** I ride?
Why?

Also included in the photo dump were pictures of Swedish producer and longtime collaborator Max Martin. On December 7 and December 17, 2023, she shared several pictures and clips of herself and members of her team working in recording studios and editing audio files. Grande confirmed a 2024 album release via her social media on December 27, 2023.

On January 4, 2024, Grande went in public wearing a custom sweatshirt that read ""yes, and?"" to tease the lead single's title, which she had previously done for her Sweetener lead single ""no tears left to cry"". The phrase was confirmed to be the name of the lead single when Grande officially announced the song via her social media. Jem Aswad of Variety commented that ""yes, and?"" was a successor to ""thank u, next"", the title of her fifth studio album and its lead single.

""yes, and?"" is Grande's first solo musical output since Positions. Its pre-save and pre-order links for streaming services and its CD single were first shared via the Sweetener Instagram page. The artwork was partially revealed in December 2023 with a defocused close-up shot of Grande's red lips via R.E.M. Beauty packages that were sent to fans, with a note: ""See you next year"". Grande revealed its cover artwork via social media on January 7, 2024, which shows a blurry shot of the left side of her face. In it, she wears the ""On Your Collar"" classic lipstick of the red shade ""Attention"", which is a part of the R.E.M. Beauty collection. It was photographed by Katia Temkin. According to Grande, the single cover will also serve as one of the album's cover variants.

Directed by Christian Breslauer, the music video for ""yes, and?"" was released via Grande's Vevo channel on YouTube at 10:00 AM EST on January 12, ten hours after the song's release. The visual is inspired by Paula Abdul's ""Cold Hearted"" video and its ""late-'80s energy"". <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Ariana+Grande/_/yes,+and%3F"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Better listen when I talk,

Your heat in the car, mine's in this bitch

I'ma kick it at the bar 'til it's time to go
Then I'ma get in shawty ear and I'ma let her know[Chorus]
All a nigga really need is a lil' bit
Not a lot, baby girl, just a lil' bit

Get to kissin' and touchin' a lil' bit
Get to lickin' it, in a lil' bit

This is 50 comin' out your stereos
Hard to tell though 'cause I switched the flow
Eyes a lil' low 'cause I twist the 'dro
Pockets on swoll 'cause I move the O's
My neck, my wrist, my ears is froze
Come get your bitch, she on me, dawg
She musta heard about the dough
Now Captain, come on and Save-a-Ho
I get it crunk in the club, I'm off the chain
Number one on the chart all the time mane
When the kid in the house, I turn it out
Keep the dancefloor packed, that's without a doubt
But shawty shake that thang like a pro, man
She backed it up on me I'm like ""Oh, man""
I got close enough to her, so I know she could hear
System thumpin', party jumpin', I said loud and clear[Chorus]
All a nigga really need is a lil' bit
Not a lot, baby girl, just a lil' bit

Hey
This is a story I hate
And tellin' it might make me break
But I'll tell it anyway
This chapter's about
How you said there was nobody else
Then you got up and went to her house
You guys always left me out
[Pre-Chorus]
I still have the letter you wrote when you told me
That I was the only girl you'd ever want in your life
I guess my friends were right
[Chorus]
Each day goes by and each night, I cry
Somebody saw you with her last night
You gave me your word, ""Don't worry 'bout her""
You might love her now, but you loved me first
Said you'd never hurt me, but here we are
Oh, you swore on every star
How could you be so reckless with my heart?
[Verse 2]
You check in and out
Of my heart like a hotel
And she must be perfect, oh well
I hope you both go to hell[Pre-Chorus]

Say I'm number one on your to-do list
I’m available (
Yeah-yeah
)
I’m available
[Verse 1]
Nothin' like your hands on me
Regret the moments that they’re off me and let it sink in
Hear me talkin', don't ignore me
I was just about to call it, what you thinkin'?
Been thinkin’ 'bout you, can't get this vision out my head
Got a grip, I'm holdin' onto every thing you say
Ain't makin' this up just to get you in my bed
If you ain't left, yeah, you can go ahead[Pre-Chorus]
Thinkin' 'bout you, it ain't always 'bout me
Don't make any sense in you bein' lonely
Hurry up and get here now, but don't speed
I'll never get over you up under me
[Chorus]
I'm available (
Yeah-yeah
)
Oh, yes, I am (
Yeah-yeah
)
I'm available (
Yeah-yeah
)
Yeah, for you, I am
Don't mean to sound desperate
But you made it like this
Say I'm number one on your to-do list
I'm available (
Yeah-yeah
)
I'm available
[Post-Chorus]
Got my arms wide open (Arms wide open)
Got my arms wide open (Arms wide open)
[Verse 2]
I get frustrated when you're busy
Lately, that's been more than often, baby, what is this?
It's like, do you even miss me?
Feelin' less than priority, you got me convinced
Convinced I'm the only one, trippin' in my head
Because in reality, you live in my bed
I'm supposed to hold onto everything you said
Yes or no question, don't leave it unread[Chorus]
Are you available (
Yeah-yeah
) now?
Oh, here I am, (
Yeah-yeah
) oh, here I am
Are you available? (
Yeah-yeah
)
Just tell me, ""Yeah""
'Cause for you, I am
You know I am
Don't mean to sound desperate
But you made it like this
Say I'm number one on your to-do list
Are you available (
Yeah-yeah

Like I'm available?

Position of Power Lyrics
Pretty straightforward braggadocio from 50 over a hard beat. Off his sophomore album, The Massacre.
[Intro]
Ha ha ha! I told niggas (Yeah) not to shoot dice with me
Look at this stack
I got money, I got money!
Ha ha ha
[Refrain]
Aw nigga don't trip,
 I'll kill you if you fuck with my grip
I won't hesitate to let off a clip
Aw nigga don't trip,
 you gon' make me get on some shit
Run up on you quick, wet up your whip
Aw nigga don't trip,
 you gon' get your monkey-ass hit
Runnin your lip, tryna fuck with my clique
Aw nigga don't trip,
 in case you didn't know who this is
It's 50 Cent bitch, G-Unit
Aw nigga don't trip
[Verse 1]
I come through your hood, stuntin' in my yellow Lam'
Murcielago, top down, nigga damn
I'm the biggest crook from New York since Son of Sam
Cruising, bumping Buck's shit, Ruger in my hand
Thinking the East ain't enough, it's time to expand
I plan to head out West and plant my feet down
A nigga big as King Kong in the street now
I do a little house shopping, and buy me a crib
It's palm trees and pretty bitches out in Cali kid
I touch the Hollywood paper, go and shoot me some flicks
Have some supermodel bitches come and suck on some dick
Mama'd turn in her grave if I married a white chick
But Becky'll suck the chrome off a Chevy and shit
Niggas be wearing fake shines, I'm rocking a lil' charm
30 carats on the pinky, kiss the ring on the Don
Crack open that Cali bud, stuff the weed in the palm[Chorus]
Nigga you hustle, but me I'll hustle harder
I got what you need; them trees, that hard, that powder
My niggas move G-packs, every hour on the hour
They shoot when I say shoot, so I'm in a position of power
You fuck around if you wanna
[Verse 2]
Where I'm from you learn to blend in or get touched
I don't need niggas for support, I don't walk with a crutch
Niggas know my steez, they don't fuck with me son
You got a appetite for hollow-tips, I feed you my gun
This is that Ferrari F-50 shit, it's real laid back
Type shit you recline to in the Maybach
I got two shooters now on the run from the fuzz
You get the same shit for ten bodies you get from one cuz
I live life in the fast lane; hundred miles an hour
Chrome and some wood grain
You know a nigga still really tryin to move 'caine
Make a little extra money on the side mayne, I ain't playing
I'm up early with the birds, word, putting that work in
Pirellis on the Porsche chirping, I'm making moves
I got a hundred mil from music, a hundred grand from crack
Gonna see my jeweler so I can blow a stack
[Chorus]
Nigga you hustle, but me I'll hustle harder
I got what you need; them trees, that hard, that powder
My niggas move G-packs, every hour on the hour
They shoot when I say shoot, so I'm in a position of power
You fuck around if you wanna",https://genius.com/50-cent-position-of-power-lyrics,"",""

Here she comes and then she's gone again, and

I'm just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my heart's behind the pocket of my shirt
I'll just keep rollin' 'til I'm in the dirt
'Cause I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller
I couldn't tell you, honey, I don't know
Where I'm goin', but I've got to go
'Cause every turn reveals some other road

Always lost and nowhere bound

The video, directed by Bradley and Pablo and released on 13 July 2022, finds Styles following a portal in his own bed that leads him to an array of other beds — one in an art gallery, another in a restaurant, a theatre, and another that speeds through the streets of London past Buckingham Palace. The clip also comes complete with a pillow fight and Styles officiating a bed-ridden wedding, before falling through the sky on his bed.

He performed a live version of the song on the Today Show on May 19, and also included the song in a set he performed for BBC Radio 1, along with ""As It Was"", ""Boyfriends"" and a cover of ""Wet Dream"" by Wet Leg on 24 May 2022. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Harry+Styles/_/Late+Night+Talking"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

ordinary things Lyrics
[Intro: Ariana Grande]
Hmm
[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
We could go pop all the champagne in California
We could have omakase in Tokyo if you wanna
Hypothetically, we (We) could do (Do)
Anything that we like
We could hit up all the slopes in matching snowsuits
We could hang out at the Louvre all night if you want to
We could spend every dime
But I don't want (Want) anything ('Thing)
But more time
[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
No matter what we do
There's never gonna be an ordinary thing
No ordinary things with you
It's funny, but it's true
There's never gonna be an ordinary thing
As long as I'm with you
[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
You hit just like the first sip of wine after a long day
You hit like my biggеst fan when I hear what the critiquеs say
You hit just like a green light when I'm stuck runnin' real late
I don't need no diamonds, just your time[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
No matter what we do
There's never gonna be an ordinary thing
No ordinary things with you
It's funny, but it's true
There's never gonna be an ordinary thing
As long as I'm with you
[Bridge: Ariana Grande]
Ordinary thing, ordinary things with you
Ordinary thing, as long as I'm with you
[Outro: Marjorie Grande]
And when he'd come home, and I'd see him (
Is it difficult?
)
When he first gets off that train
It was like God Almighty arrived
It was like seein' daylight
I mean, I could've packed up and left a million times
You know? It's not that we never fought
You can overcome that
You know? It-it's very easy
And as I told her, never go to bed without kissin' goodnight
That's the worst thing to do, don't ever, ever do that
And if you can't, and if you don't feel comfortable doing it

Whiskey Sunrise Lyrics
[Verse 1]
There's a tear in the mud on the banks of the river
And the sound of a lover's goodbye
And a pain in my heart 'cause I could not forgive her
That's as deep as the river is wide
I'm lost and I'm lonesome when I look in the mirror
I don't like the man that I see
And the more that I look, the more it gets clearer
Pride made a fool out of me
[Chorus]
So I drink all night
But the hurtin' won't stop
And every shot I take just turns into teardrops
When I lay down to sleep
And I pray I don't open my eyes
To a whiskey sunrise
[Verse 2]
The cold wind blows and the leaves start to scatter
And the rain will be comin' on soon
And everything's wrong and nothin' don't matter
And a black cloud is crossin' the moon
[Chorus]
So I drink all night
But the hurtin' won't stop
And every shot I take just turns into teardrops
And I lay down to sleep
And I pray I don't open my eyes

[Verse 1]
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness' sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well, I ain't
[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself[Verse 2]
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from
[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself[Verse 3]
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Pre-Chorus]
Help me, it's like the walls are cavin' in
Sometimes, I feel like givin' up
But I just can't
[Chorus]
It isn't in my blood
[Verse 1]
Layin' on the bathroom floor, feelin' nothin'
I'm overwhelmed and insecure, give me somethin'
I could take to ease my mind slowly
Just have a drink and you'll feel better
Just take her home and you'll feel better
Keep tellin' me that it gets better
Does it ever?
[Pre-Chorus]
Help me
It's like the walls are cavin' in
Sometimes, I feel like givin' up

It isn't in my blood
It isn't in my blood

I'm lookin' through my phone again, feelin' anxious
Afraid to be alone again, I hate this
I'm tryin' to find a way to chill, can't breathe, oh

Is there somebody who could help me?
It's like the walls are cavin' in
Sometimes, I feel like givin' up
No medicine is strong enough

Sometimes, I feel like givin' up
But I just can't

It isn't in my blood
It isn't in my blood (Ayy)

Release and promotion

On March 16, 2018, Mendes first posted a collage on social media consisting of two uncaptioned images of blank color blocks, one in beige and one in coral. He later changed his profile picture to be the same beige background color with a floral design, as featured in the single artwork. On March 19, Mendes partnered with Spotify to promote the single on a billboard in New York's Times Square that reads ""Shawn Mendes coming soon"". Shortly after, he posted a video that includes two dates: March 22 and March 23. The dates are also projected in various places in London. He officially announced the song on March 20, along with its release date and single artwork. ""This song,"" he wrote in a social media post, ""is the closest song to my heart that I've ever written"" 

Composition

""In My Blood"" is a rock ballad, whose acoustic opening was described as ""soft and despairing"". As the song progresses, ""an insistent drum comes in"" before Mendes' voice rises on the chorus. A Rolling Stone contributor noted that the chorus features ""shuddering drums"" and ""throbbing electric guitars"", with ""choral backing vocals"" that ""add soothing textures to the final hook"". <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Shawn+Mendes/_/In+My+Blood"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Out Like That Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You got me all caught up
The way you look tonight
We could head downtown
Or I can turn around, up here, on the right
Ah, just look at this sky
The rain ain’t far from fallin’ down
And I wanna get to know you
Better than I know this little town, yes I do
[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna feel your heart go tic-toc
While the rain from your hair drip-drops
Parked out in the middle of nowhere
[Chorus]
There’s a place I can get up against your lips
That’s where I gotta be with you lookin' like this
Let’s get lost somewhere
Anywhere we ain’t gotta hold back
If we’re gonna go out, baby
Let's go out like that
[Verse 2]
And I’ll grab your door
You can take my hand
Hop up on my shoulders and I’ll walk us over
Where we can dance
And I’ll leave the headlights on
So, I can see your face
Spin you ‘round in the mud
Yeah, soak it all up, baby
What’cha say, what’cha say[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna feel your heart go tic-toc
While the rain from your hair drip-drops
Girl, I’m talkin' country kinda crazy, yeah
[Chorus]
Out where I can get up against your lips
That’s where I gotta be with you lookin' like this
Let’s get lost somewhere
Anywhere we ain’t gotta hold back
If we’re gonna go out, baby
Let's go out like that
[Pre-Bridge]
Yeah, I wanna feel your heart go tic-toc
While the rain from your hair drip-drops
Gettin’ country kinda crazy in the middle of nowhere
[Bridge]
Out where I can get up against your lips
That’s where I gotta be with you lookin' like this
Let’s get lost somewhere
Anywhere we ain’t gotta hold back
If we’re gonna go out, baby
Let's go out, baby[Chorus]
If we’re gonna go out, baby
Let’s go out like that

[Intro]
You can feel it, feel it
(Yeah, yeah)
[Verse 1]
They say my system is overloaded
(Girl, what's wrong with you? Come back down)
I'm too much in my head, did you notice? Mm-mm
(Girl, what's wrong with you? Come back down)
My body's here on Earth, but I'm floatin'
(Girl, what's wrong with you? Come back down; Down)
Disconnected, so sometimes, I feel frozen and alone
[Chorus]
This is for everybody
Babe, you gotta take care of your body (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ain't no time to deny it (Yeah), that is why we talking about it (Get better)
Yeah, we talking about it (Get better, get better)
To deal with it, don't try to get by it (Get better, get better)
Ain't no time to deny it (Get better, get better)
So we had to sit down and just write it
 (Get better)
[Verse 2]
Want you to get better (Woo!)
My life is so controlled by the what-ifs
(Girl, what's wrong with you? Come back down)
Is there anybody else whose mind does this, mm-mm?
(Girl, what's wrong with you? Come back down)
Down, down, down, down
Is there such a ladder to get above this? 
(Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down)
(Girl, what's wrong with you? Come back down)
(Down, down, down, down)
Maybe I should ground myself where the mud is
 (Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down)
Before I'm gone[Chorus]
This is for everybody
Babe, you gotta take care of your body (Uh-huh; Yuh, yuh)
Ain't no time to deny it (Yuh; Oh, yeah), that is why we talking about it (Yuh, yuh; Baby)
(Get better)
Yeah, we talking about it (Get better, get better)
To deal with it, don't try to get by it (Get better, get better; Ooh)
Ain't no time to deny it (Get better, get better; Yeah)
So we had to sit down and just write it (Get better)

You can work your way to the top
 (You can feel it, feel it)
(Ooh; Oh, my)
Just know that there's up and downs and there's drops (You can feel it, feel it)

(Ooh)
Just know there is so much room at the top
 (You can feel it, feel it, yee)
(Ooh)
[Refrain]
(Ah, ah, ah)
Well, here's one thing you can trust (Yuh)
It take you and me to make us (Yeah)
One of those days you had enough (Yeah), I'll be there (Yeah, yuh, yuh, yuh)
'Cause if it ain't one thing, it's another (It's another)
When you need someone to pull you out the bubble (Out the bubble)
I'll be right there just to hug you (Just to hug you),
 I'll be there (Yuh, yuh, hey)
Where are you? Are you home? (Where are you? Are you home?)
Call me right on the phone (Call me right on the phone)
I'll be there (Ayy, sheesh), yeah, I'll be there (Yuh, yuh)
I don't care who is gone (I don't care who is gone), you shouldn't be alone (You shouldn't be alone)
I'll be there (Mm-mm), there[Bridge]
You can work your way to the top (Woo!)
 (You can feel it, feel it, woo)
(I'm with you, I'm with you, I'm with you, just call me, I'm with you, I'm with you)
Just know that there's up and downs and there's drops (You can feel it, feel it, babe)
(I'm with you, I'm with you, I'm with you, just call me, I'm with you, I'm with you; Ah, ayy)
Unfollow fear and just say, ""You are blocked"" (You can feel it, feel it, yuh)

On a 2018 Beats 1  Interview, someone asked: Why was it called ""get well soon?"" Pharrell Williams (The Producer) commented: People who are often dealing with mental health issues don’t signal loud enough for the world to understand that they’re suffering. And also our hearing for people who are going through stuff like that needs work too; the way in which we listen and the way in which we acknowledge people. We need to pay attention to those signs and those signals.
What I love about “get well soon” is this is Ari going through something not quite as severe but going through a situation where she was depressed … and she had the willingness to put that out there for the world and that’s how we made “get well soon” because she was open and she trusted and she let me push.
We wanted this to be a hallmark card for that kind of situation. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Ariana+Grande/_/Get+Well+Soon"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."

[Intro]
[Verse 1]
Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me
You found me-e-e-e-e
I guess you didn't care and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me
Without me-e-e-e-e
[Pre-Chorus]
And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me
[Chorus]
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now, I'm lying on the cold, hard ground[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
[Verse 2]
No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning
You're drowning-ing-ing-ing-ing
And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now, I see, now, I see
Now, I see-e-e-e-e
[Pre-Chorus]
He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, yeah
[Chorus]
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Oh)
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (Yeah)
Now, I'm lying on the cold, hard ground[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble (Yeah, trouble)
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
[Bridge]
And the saddest fear
Comes creeping in
That you never loved me
Or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah
[Chorus]
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (Never been)
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Knew it right there)
So shame on me now (Knew it right there)
Flew me to places I'd never been (Ooh)
Now, I'm lying on the cold, hard ground
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh

Displaced and stretched it out in every way

[Verse 1]
It feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes
Uh-uh, uh-uh
It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers
Uh-uh, uh-uh
[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah
We're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time, oh-oh
[Chorus]
I don't know about you
But I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancing like we're
Twenty-two, twenty-two[Verse 2]
It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids
Uh-uh, uh-uh (Who's Taylor Swift, anyway? Ew)
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
And end up dreamin'
Instead of sleeping
[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah
We're happy, free, confused and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
It's time, oh-oh
[Chorus]
(Hey!) I don't know about you
But I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if (Ooh)
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if (Alright)
We just keep dancing like we're
Twenty-two (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh), twenty-two (I don't know about you)
Twenty-two, twenty-two (Ooh)[Bridge]
It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleepin'
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you (You)
Woah, ooh, yeah, eh-yeah
[Chorus]
(Hey!) I don't know about you (I don't know about you)
But I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if (Ooh)
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me (You don't know about me)
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancing like we're (Dancing like we're twenty-two)
Twenty-two (Woah-oh), twenty-two (Dancing like)
Twenty-two (Yeah, yeah), twenty-two (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Swift wrote the song with its producers Max Martin and Shellback. It was released as the album's fourth single on March 12, 2013, by Big Machine Records. Musically, ""22"" combines pop styles such as dance-pop and bubblegum pop with a disco production and pulsing synthesizers. The track begins with a twangy acoustic guitar riff and progresses into an upbeat refrain. The lyrics celebrate being 22-years-old while acknowledging the heartache that the narrator experienced in the past; some media noted that ""22"" became a cultural phenomenon resulting in the prominence of 22nd birthdays.

Music critics complimented the single's catchy production and retrospectively considered it one of Swift's best pop songs. ""22"" peaked at number 20 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It received platinum or higher certifications in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, peaking in the top 10 on the single chart in the lattermost country. The accompanying music video was shot in Malibu, California, depicting Swift having a house party with friends. Swift included the song in the set list of the Red Tour (2013–2014) and performed it live at the 2013 Billboard Music Awards.

A re-recorded version of ""22"", titled ""22 (Taylor's Version)"", was released as part of Swift's second re-recorded album ""Red (Taylor's Version)"" on November 12, 2021, by Republic Records. ""22 (Taylor's Version)"" peaked within the top 40 on singles charts of Australia, Canada, and Singapore; and peaked at number 52 on the US Billboard Hot 100.

After writing her third studio album ""Speak Now"" entirely solo, Taylor Swift opted to collaborate with different songwriters and producers for ""Red"". Thus, she called Max Martin and Shellback, two songwriters and producers whose work she admired, to discuss a possible collaboration. She told Billboard magazine: ""For me, being 22 has been my favorite year of my life. I like all the possibilities of how you're still learning, but you know enough. You still know nothing, but you know that you know nothing. You're old enough to start planning your life, but you're young enough to know there are so many unanswered questions. That brings about a carefree feeling that is sort of based on in-decision and fear and at the same time letting loose. Being 22 has taught me so much"".

The song was officially supposed to impact contemporary hit radio in the United States on March 5, 2013, before being pushed back by one week to March 12, 2013, and in the UK on March 31, 2013. An exclusive limited edition individually numbered CD single was also released exclusively to Swift's store on March 13, 2013, the same day the music video was released. The CD single was sold by itself or via an exclusive package with the Red Tour items and a T-shirt.

The music video for ""22"" was filmed in February 2013, and premiered on March 13, 2013. It was directed by Anthony Mandler, who had previously directed the music video for Swift's ""I Knew You Were Trouble"". The video, presented in a 4:3 aspect ratio format, shows Swift bouncing on trampolines, playing on the beach and having a house party with her friends. As of January 2022, the video has more than 600 million views on YouTube. The music video was shot in Malibu, California. Actress Jessica Szohr cameos.

Several songs from ""Red"", including ""22"", charted in different countries due to strong digital sales following the release of the album. ""22"" debuted at number 44 on United States Billboard Hot 100 chart, as well as at number seven on Billboard Hot Digital Songs chart with sales of 108,000. It later re-entered the Hot 100 at number 84 on the chart week of January 12, 2013. When it was again released as a single, it reentered the charts at number 64. ""22"" also debuted at number 29 on the Billboard Canadian Hot 100 chart and peaked at number 20. It also managed to reach number nine on the UK Singles Chart. It reached 2 million in sales by 2014. As of November 2017, the song had sold 2.3 million copies in the United States. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Swift/_/22"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Running blind in truth

Seven misleadin' statements 'bout my persona
Six headlights wavin' in my direction (Come on)
Five-O askin' me what's in my possession
Yeah, I keep runnin', jump in the aqueducts
Fire hydrants and hazardous
Smoke alarms on the back of us
But mama, don't cry for me, ride for me
Try for me, live for me
Breathe for me, sing for me
Honestly guidin' me
I could be more than I gotta be
Stole from me, lied to me, nation hypocrisy
Code on me, drive on me
Wicked, my spirit inspired me, like yeah
Open correctional gates in higher desert (Yeah)
Open our mind as we cast away oppression (Yeah)
Open the streets and watch our beliefs
And when they carve my name inside the concrete
I pray it forever reads[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Freedom, freedom, I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose
Freedom, freedom, where are you?
'Cause I need freedom, too
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell

Is it truth you seek? Oh, father, can you hear me?
What you want from me?
Is it truth you seek? Oh, father, can you hear me?
Hear me out

Man

I went to junior high with all of them, and they

The Car Bomb Lyrics
The Car Bomb is a skit preformed by Mel-Man and Charis Henry as a prelude to the next track. It’s a short dialogue that ends in a murder via an explosion from a car bomb, hence the title.

Charis Henry

School Spirit (Skit 1) Lyrics
In this skit, the speaker delivers an incredibly sarcastic monologue to Jimmy which explains how degrees by themselves will not get you far in life. This continues the theme of The College Dropout, which is a…

[Skit 1: DeRay Davis]
Now beat that!
And your mother's saying ""Go to college""
So you finish college
 
and it's wonderful
You feel so good
And after all the partying and craziness
And don't forget about that drug habit you picked up at school being around your peers
Hey!
Now you'll get that 25-thousand dollar job a year
And you'll spend all your money on crack cocaine
But, it'll be YOUR money
No more borrowing from mom for my high!
So now you get your degree tattooed on your back
You're so excited about it
If you continue to work at the Gap, after several interviews, oh my God
You'll come in at a entry-level position
And when you do that
If you kiss enough ass
You'll move up to the next level
Which is being the secretary's secretary
And boy, is that great
You get to take messages for the secretary
Who NEVER went to college
She's actually the boss's niece!
So now you're part of the family
You know what college does for you?
It makes you really smart, man
All you kids wanted to talk in the back of the class
Not me, I listened
Okay?
I was a hall monitor
This was meant to be
You know how many classes I took?
Extra classes, extra classes
No, I've never had sex
But you know what?
My degree keeps me satisfied
When a lady walks up to me and says
""Hey, you know what's sexy?""
I said, no, I don't know what it is
But I bet I can add up all the change in your purse
Very fast",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-school-spirit-skit-1-lyrics,"",""

[Verse 1]
She was a fast machine, she kept her motor clean
She was the best damn woman that I ever seen
She had the sightless eyes, tellin' me no lies
Knockin' me out with those American thighs
Takin' more than her share, had me fightin' for air
She told me to come, but I was already there
'Cause the walls start shakin', the Earth was quakin'
My mind was achin', and we were makin' it
[Chorus]
And you
Shook me all night long
Yeah, you
Shook me all night long
[Verse 2]
Workin' double-time on the seduction line
She's one of a kind, she's just a-mine, all mine
Wanted no applause, 
just another course
Made a meal outta me, and come back for more
Had to cool me down to take another round
Now, I'm back in the ring to take another swing
That the walls were shakin', the Earth was quakin'
My mind was achin', and we were makin' it[Chorus]
And you
Shook me all night long
Yeah, you
Shook me all night long
It knocked me out that you
Shook me all night long
It had me shakin' and you
Shook me all night long
[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, you shook me
Well, you took me
[Guitar Solo]

You really took me and you
Shook me all night long
Ah, you

The song also reappeared on their later album Who Made Who. It is AC/DC's first single with Brian Johnson as the lead singer, replacing Bon Scott who died of alcohol poisoning in February 1980. It reached #35 on the USA's Hot 100 pop singles chart in 1980. The single was re-released internationally in 1986, following the release of the album Who Made Who. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/AC%2FDC/_/You+Shook+Me+All+Night+Long"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.","""You Shook Me All Night Long"" is a song by hard rock band AC/DC, from the album Back in Black.

It reached #35 on the USA's Hot 100 pop singles chart in 1980. The single was re-released internationally in 1986, following the release of the album Who Made Who. The re-released single in 1986 contains the B-side(s): B1. ""She's Got Balls"" (Live, Bondi Lifesaver '77); B2. ""You Shook Me All Night Long"" (Live '83 – 12-inch maxi-single only).

In January 2018, as part of Triple M's ""Ozzest 100"", the 'most Australian' songs of all time, ""You Shook Me All Night Long"" was ranked #63.

""You Shook Me All Night Long"" placed at #10 on VH1's list of ""The 100 Greatest Songs of the 80s"". It was also #1 on VH1's ""Top Ten AC/DC Songs"". Guitar World placed ""You Shook Me All Night Long"" at #80 on their ""100 Greatest Guitar Solos"" list.

The song has also become a staple of AC/DC concerts, and is rarely excluded from the setlist. Four live versions of the song were officially released. The first one appeared on the 1986 maxi-single ""You Shook Me All Night Long""; the second one was included on the band's album Live; the third version is on the soundtrack to the Howard Stern movie Private Parts, and also appears on the AC/DC box set Backtracks; and the fourth one is on the band's live album, Live at River Plate.[citation needed]

""You Shook Me All Night Long"" was also the second song to be played by AC/DC on Saturday Night Live in 2000, following their performance of ""Stiff Upper Lip."" When AC/DC was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2003 by Steven Tyler of Aerosmith, they performed this song with Tyler.

Johnson performed the song with Billy Joel at Madison Square Garden in New York, US in March 2014. The Salon publication stated on the following morning in its introduction to the video footage of the performance: ""This will either be your favorite video today, or a total musical nightmare!""

There have been several claims made over decades that (at least) some parts of the lyrics to the song were written by Bon Scott.

Silver Smith, late former girlfriend of Bon Scott, interviewed by Jesse Fink for his biography of Scott, Bon: The Last Highway, said: 'I know for sure that [the song] was written at [my flat in] Gloucester Road [in Kensington, London] back in ’76. ""She told me to come but I was already there"" – he wrote that in a letter to somebody, one of his grotty mates, just after we got together, actually. He always kept notebooks and added and subtracted to them and so on. He put in ""American thighs"" even way back then, because that was the market they were going to try and crack. So that was written a long time ago.' In the same book, Scott's girlfriend in Miami, Florida, a woman under the pseudonym 'Holly X', says the original lyric 'chartreuse eyes' was changed to 'sightless eyes' and that she had a horse called Doubletime. The lyrics 'working double time on the seduction line' appear in the finished song.

Doug Thaler, Bon's friend and AC/DC's booking agent on their American tours, also says: 'I don't care who tells me anything different: you can bet your life that Bon Scott wrote the lyrics to ""You Shook Me All Night Long"". It's Bon Scott's lyrics all over the place.'

From AC/DC: Hell Ain't a Bad Place to Be by Mick Wall: 'However Malcolm Dome claims that shortly before he died, Bon ""shoved me his book of lyrics. He had sheets of lyrics that he kept in a file, carried them around. He'd been showing me some of the ideas he'd been working for Back in Black. Not the song 'Back in Black' but songs that were for the next album. There were a couple of lines, like, 'She told me to come but I was already there', which ended up in 'You Shook Me All Night Long' - that’s a Bon lyric. And I saw it. I saw it written down. There were lyrics, lines used, on Back in Black that Bon wrote. [But] he wasn’t credited and to this day no one's really sure what happened. I don’t think he even got close to finishing the whole songs. But there are lines in there that I know.'

Malcolm Dome again in Classic Rock, August 2005, pg. 46: 'Bon proudly showed me some of the scribbles he'd put down in preparation for an album he felt would define AC/DC - and open up new possibilities as well. It’s hard to be absolutely accurate from a distance of quarter of a century, and through the haze of alcohol which enveloped the night, but one line sticks in my mind as being on one of those sheets: ""She told me to come, but I was already there."" A renowned lyric from the song You Shook Me All Night Long, it has Bon's trademark all over it - a neatly worked double entendre that fits in with the track record of a man who wrote Big Balls, The Jack and other similarly styled songs.' <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/AC%2FDC/_/You+Shook+Me+All+Night+Long"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

On its surface, the second single from Purpose seems to be an apology to a woman for making mistakes…

[Written by Julia Michaels, Justin Tranter, and Justin Bieber]
[Verse 1]
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try, but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
And by once or twice, I mean maybe a couple of hundred times
So let me, oh, let me redeem, oh, redeem, oh, myself tonight
'Cause I just need one more shot at second chances

Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body

I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, yeah
Sorry
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?[Verse 2]
I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this?
[Chorus]
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
I'm not just tryna get you back on me (Oh, no, no)
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body (Your body)
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, oh
Sorry
Yeah, I know that I let you down (I know I let you down)

[Chorus]
I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you love me
The start of nothin'
I had no chance to prepare, I couldn't see you comin'
The start of nothin'
Ooh, I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
When we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good
[Verse 1]
If I could see through walls, I could see you're fakin'
If you could see my thoughts, you would see our faces
Safe in my rental like an armored truck back then
We didn't give a fuck back then
I ain't a kid no more
We'll never be those kids again
We'd drive to Syd's
Had the X6 back then, back then
No matter what I did, my waves wouldn't dip back then
Everything sucked back then, we were friends
[Chorus]
I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you love me
The start of nothin'
I had no chance to prepare, I couldn't see you comin'
The start of nothin'
Ooh, I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
But we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good[Verse 2]
In the halls of your hotel
Arm around my shoulder so I could tell
How much I meant to you, meant it sincere back then
We had time to kill back then
You ain't a kid no more, we'll never be those kids again
It's not the same, ivory's illegal, don't you remember?
[Bridge]
I broke your heart last week
You'll probably feel better by the weekend
Still remember, had you going crazy
Screamin' my name, the feeling deep down is good
[Chorus]
I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you love me
The start of nothin'
Had no chance to prepare, couldn't see you comin'
And we started from nothin'
Ooh, I could hate you now
It's alright to hate me now
We both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good
[Outro]
All the things I didn't mean to say, I didn't mean to do
There were things you didn't need to say, did you mean to? Mean to?
I've been dreamin' of you, dreamin' of you
I've been dreamin' of you, dreamin' of you

Parts of the song show Frank drowning in tears and filled with anger. In a November 2016 interview with the New York Times, Frank admitted to altering his voice in order to make it sound younger to better encapsulate the emotions of young love.

The song may be about Ocean’s first love, which he detailed in his 2012 open Tumblr letter.

Ivy is somewhat of a parasitic plant. It strangles adjacent trees and isn’t good for their health. In the context of the song, it may be a reflection of their unhealthy relationship. Ivy explores a failed relationship of Frank’s as he reflects on their relationship and his mistakes.

Frank and the person he’s singing about seems to have grown up and grew apart in the process. While he was overwhelmed when his partner told him that he/she loved him, he wasn’t prepared emotionally. In hindsight, the relationship was “the start of nothing” because they eventually separated.

Like an armored truck, the emotional walls Frank put up when he was younger were hard to get past—he didn’t let this person fully in. While this made him safer, it may be the reason why their relationship ended. Frank does however affirm the idea that the relationship was worthwhile and a memory to keep.

Frank performed a rough demo version of “Ivy” at the BMW Welt in Munich, the first stop of his European tour California Live, in June 2013.

The lyric “it started from nothing” has been much debated on this page, as it sounds like “the start of nothing” is a better syllabic fit.

The lyric is actually “it started from nothing,” as verified in the album accompanying magazine, Boy’s Don’t Cry.

Rostam Batmanglij was credited for his contributions on this song. He recollected to Billboard magazine:
""As soon as he played me ‘Ivy’ in its original form, I had a vision for what it could sound like.""

“Ivy” debuted at #80 on the Billboard Hot 100 on the chart week of September 10, 2016. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Frank+Ocean/_/Ivy"">Read more on Last.fm</a>. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply."

Fixing a Hole Lyrics
A dreamy baroque pop song by McCartney from Sgt Pepper. It’s about how McCartney’s fans would stand outside of his house all of the time, and how he saw the issue from his perspective.
[Verse 1]
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go
I'm filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where it will go
[Chorus]
And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong, I'm right
Where I belong, I'm right, where I belong
See the people standing there who disagree and never win
And wonder why they don't get in my door
[Verse 2]
I'm painting the room in a colourful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah
Hey, hey, hey, hey
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong, I'm right
Where I belong, I'm right, where I belong
Silly people run around, they worry me
And never ask me why they don't get past my door[Verse 3]
I'm taking the time for a number of things
That weren't important yesterday
And I still go
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah
[Outro]
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go, where it will go
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go",https://genius.com/The-beatles-fixing-a-hole-lyrics,"""Fixing a Hole"" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1967 album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. It was written by Paul McCartney and credited to Lennon–McCartney.

In a 1968 interview, McCartney said that the song was ""about the hole in the road where the rain gets in, a good old analogy – the hole in your make-up which lets the rain in and stops your mind from going where it will.""

The first of two recording sessions for ""Fixing a Hole"" was at Regent Sound Studios in London on 9 February 1967, in three takes. Regent Sound was used because all three studios at EMI's Abbey Road Studios were unavailable that night, so it was the first time that the Beatles used a British studio other than Abbey Road for an EMI recording. Also present at the session was a man who had arrived at McCartney's house in St John's Wood, shortly before McCartney was due to depart for the studio, and introduced himself as Jesus Christ. McCartney later recalled:

There were a lot of casualties about then. We used to get a lot of people who were maybe insecure or going through emotional breakdowns or whatever. So I said, ""I've got to go to a session but if you promise to be very quiet and just sit in a corner, you can come."" So he did, he came to the session and he did sit very quietly and I never saw him after that. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/Fixing+a+Hole"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

They looking for a check
Tell 'em it ain't likely
Said she need a ring like Carmelo
You must be on that white like Othello
All you want is Nikes, but the real ones
Just like you, just like me
I don't play, I don't make time
But if you need dick, I got you
And I yam from the line
Pour up for A$AP, R.I.P. Pimp C
R.I.P. Trayvon, that nigga look just like me
Woo, fuckin' buzzin', woo
That my little cousin, he got a little trade
His girl keep the scales, a little mermaid
We out by the pool, some little mermaids
Me and them gel like twigs with them bangs
Now that's a real mermaid
You been holding your breath, weighted down
Punk madre, punk papá
He don't care for me, but he cares for me
And that's good enough
We don't talk much or nothin'
But when we talkin' 'bout somethin'
We have good discussion
I met his friends last week
Feels like they're up to somethin'
That's good for us[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]

We'll let you guys prophesy
We gon' see the future first
We'll let you guys prophesy
We gon' see the future first
Living so the last night feels like a past life
Speaking of the don't know what got into people
Devil be possessin' homies
Demons try to body-jump
Why you think I'm in this bitch wearing a fucking yarmulke?
Acid on me like the rain
Weed crumbles into glitter
Rain,
 
glitter
We laid out on this wet floor
Away turf, no Astro'
Mesmerized how the strobes glow
Look at all the people feet dance
I know that your nigga came witcha
But he ain't witcha

[Verse 1]
Taxi driver
Be my shrink for the hour
Leave the meter runnin'
It's rush hour
So take the streets if you wanna
Just outrun the demons, could you?
[Pre-Chorus]
He said, ""Allahu akbar""
I told him, ""Don't curse me""
""Bobo, you need prayer""
I guess it couldn't hurt me
[Chorus]
If it brings me to my knees
It's a bad religion
Ooh-hoo, this unrequited love
To me, it's nothin' but a one-man cult
And cyanide in my styrofoam cup
I can never make him love me
Never make him love me
Love me, love me
Love me, love me (Ooh-hoo)
Love me, love me (Ooh-hoo)
Love me, love me (Ooh-hoo)
Love me, love[Verse 2]
Taxi driver
I swear, I've got three lives
Balanced on my head like steak knives
I can't tell you the truth about my disguise
I can't trust no one
[Pre-Chorus]
And you say, ""Allahu akbar""
I told him, ""Don't curse me""
""Bobo, you need prayer""
I guess it couldn't hurt me, yeah
[Chorus]
If it brings me to my knees
It's a bad religion
Ah-oh, unrequited love
To me, it's nothin' but a one-man cult
And cyanide in my styrofoam cup
I can never make him love me
Never make him love me
No, no, ah
[Outro]
It's a, it's a bad religion
To be in love with someone who could never love you
Oh-oh-oh, only bad, only bad religion
Could have me feeling the way I do",https://genius.com/Frank-ocean-bad-religion-lyrics,"The fourteenth track on the album Channel Orange by Frank Ocean is a ballad where a heartbroken Frank Ocean confesses about his one-sided love.

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
Will I ever love the same way again? (
Way again
)
Will I ever love somebody like the way I did you?
Never thought you'd be so damn hard to replace
I swear it don't need to be this way
If I can't have you, is love completely off the table?
Do I sit this one out and wait for the next life? (
Next life
)
Am I too cold? Am I not nice?
Might not be quite yet healed already
Should I be goin' too steady? (
Too steady
)
But I just wanna know is love completеly off the table?
[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Will you be thеre? (Will you be there?)
Can I still love you? (Can I, can I, babe?)
Not yet healed or ready (Not ready)
Should I be goin' too steady? (Too steady)
Just wanna know is love completely off the table?
[Verse 2: The Weeknd, 
Ariana Grande
 & 
Both
]
I'll wait for you
Even though it always feels like I'll be number two
To someone you can't hold anymore
If you let me in, I'm ready to give you what I couldn't before
'Cause I got you, girl, let me help you through it
You're trying to fill the void with a couple boys
I can see right through it (
You can see right through it
)
I can love you harder than I did before
Was in a dark place back then
I was toxic, then I was toxic to 
someone else
I was haunted by the hills (Oh yeah, yeah)
I couldn't give you my all, but I will
If you let me in your arms (Your arms)
If you let me in your heart
I don't think that love's completely off the table[Chorus: Ariana Grande & 
The Weeknd
]
Will you be there? (
Yes, I will be there for you
)
Can I still love you? (
Yes, I been hurt before, before
)
Not yet healed or ready (Not ready)
Should I be goin' too steady? (Too steady, no, no)
Just wanna know is love completely off the table?
[Bridge: Ariana Grande & 
The Weeknd

So can you hold me?
If I let you, can you prove it to me? (
Oh, no-no, no
)
'Cause I need you to calm me down, babe
Gotta get out of my head (
Oh, woah
)
Tryna be here from this bed (
Oh
)
Just wanna know, just wanna know, know, know, baby (
Hey
)
Can you touch it like you believe in it, baby? (Oh, hey)
Let me think you never gonna leave on me, baby
'Cause I ain't her and you ain't him, thankfully (Baby, don't leave)
But it's gon' be hard to let someone else in again (
Woah
)
Baby, baby (
Woo-hoo
)
[Chorus: Ariana Grande & 
The Weeknd

Will you be there? (Will you be there? 
I'll still wait

Can I still love you? (
I'll still wait for you, babe, oh, no-no, no,

Not yet healed or ready (
Ooh

[Intro]
Mmm, mmm, mmm
[Verse 1]
Flowers in hand, waiting for me
Every word in poetry
Won't call me by name, 
only ""baby""
The more that you give, the less that I need
Everyone says I look happy
When it feels right
[Chorus]
I know that you're wrong for me
Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave
I brought you down to your knees
'Cause they say that misery loves company
It's not your fault I ruin everything
And it's not your fault I can't be what you need
Baby, angels like you can't fly down here with me
[Post-Chorus]
I'm everything they said I would be
La, la, la
I'm everything they said I would be
[Verse 2]
I'll put you down slow, love you goodbye
Before you let go, just one more time
Take off your clothes, pretend that it's fine
A little more hurt won't kill you
Tonight, mother says you don't look happy
Close your eyes[Chorus]
I know that you're wrong for me
Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave
I brought you down to your knees
'Cause they say that misery loves company
It's not your fault I ruin everything
And it's not your fault I can't be what you need
Baby, angels like you can't fly down here with me
[Post-Chorus]
I'm everything they said I would be
La, la, la, la
La, la, la
La, la, la
Oh, ah, ah
Ah, oh
Ah, oh
[Chorus]
I know that you're wrong for me
Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave
I brought you down to your knees
'Cause they say that misery loves company
It's not your fault I ruin everything (Everything)
And it's not your fault I can't be what you need
Baby, angels like you can't fly down here with me, oh[Outro]

In the verses, Miley talks about how the person she's with treats her well and how she appears happy, but deep down she knows that they are wrong for each other. She realizes that she brings the other person down and that she can't be what they need. She also mentions how she's been told that she would be a certain way, which could suggest that she feels like she's living up to negative expectations.

The chorus suggests that Miley knows this relationship is destined to fail and that she will regret ever getting involved. She acknowledges her responsibility in the situation, admitting that she ruins everything and that ""misery loves company"". However, she also recognizes that the other person is blameless and that they deserve someone better than her.

The post-chorus, ""I'm everything they said I would be"", suggests that Miley has internalized negative comments and criticism from others, perhaps about her inability to maintain healthy relationships.

Overall, ""Angels Like You"" appears to be a reflection on the difficulties of maintaining a relationship when one person is struggling with their own issues. The lyrics suggest a sense of regret and the realization that sometimes, even when two people care for each other, they simply can't be together. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Miley+Cyrus/_/Angels+Like+You"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

[Verse 1]
You build me up, you knock me down
Provoke a smile and make me frown
You are the queen of runaround
You know it's true
You chew me up and spit me out
Enjoy the taste I leave in your mouth
You look at me, I look at you
Neither of us know what to do
[Chorus]
There may not be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in
I shiver when I hear your name
I think about you, but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied til I'm under your skin
[Verse 2]
Immobilized by the thought of you
I'm paralyzed by the sight of you
I'm hypnotized by the words you say
Not true, but I believe 'em anyway
So come to bed, it's getting late
There's no more time for us to waste
Remember how my body tastes
You feel your heart begin to race[Chorus]
There may not be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in (Hey)
And I shiver when I hear your name
Think about you, but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied 'til I'm under your skin (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

The song was written by John Lennon at his Aunt Mimi’s house in Menlove Avenue, Liverpool.
‘Please Please Me’ is my song completely. It was my attempt at writing a Roy Orbison song, would you believe it? I wrote it in the bedroom in my house at Menlove Avenue, which was my auntie’s place… I remember the day and the pink coverlet on the bed and I heard Roy Orbison doing ‘Only The Lonely’ or something. That’s where that came from. And also I was always intrigued by the words of ‘Please, lend me your little ears to my pleas’ – a Bing Crosby song. I was always intrigued by the double use of the word ‘please’. So it was a combination of Bing Crosby and Roy Orbison. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/_/Please+Please+Me"">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
